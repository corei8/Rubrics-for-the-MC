\chap{Exposition of the Relics}{

\rubric This part of the ceremony takes place the evening before the
consecration. The candles on the table in the oratory are lit.

\rubric Assisting clergy with surplices, preceded by a server with holy-water,
go to the entrance of the oratory to receive B, vested in rochet and
mantelletta, with biretta. The Bishop removes biretta at the entrace and
receives holy water from the rector.\footcite[The bishop does not sprinkle the
clergy, as the rubrics prescribe, if he be not the Ordinary. See][note 1, p.
28.]{consecranda}

\rubric If there is an altar in the oratory, the Bishop kneels on the lowest
step before it for a short time, then rises and goes to the table, dons a red
stole, and places\footnote{The bishop must observe the order of dignity:
apostles, martyrs, confessors, etc. as can be found in the Litany of the
Saints.} the relics into the reliquary with the three grains of incense and the
attest of the consecration.

\rubric After putting the lid on the reliquary, Bishop folds around it a red silk
ribbon that passes over the top, bottom and four sides of the reliquary and is
tied at the top. Sealing wax is dropped over the knot and is sealed with the
consecrator's signet.

\rubric The Bishop carries the reliquary with both hands and places it in the
urn, locks the urn and removes his stole. The Bishop kneels for a short time in
prayer before the reliquaries, rises and is accompanied by the clergy to the
door, where he departs.\footnote{The bishop may remain to recite the office
with the clergy, though the length of the ceremony of the next day may
discourage the bishop from doing so.}

\rubric The clergy return to the relics and recite Matins and Lauds \textit{De
communi plurimorum martyrum.} The lessons of the first nocturn are
\textit{Fratres, debitores,} etc.; of the second nocturn \textit{Quotiescumque,
fratres,} etc.; of the third nocturn \textit{Dominus ac redemptor.} The oration
is \textit{Deus, qui conspicis,} without mentioning the name of the martyrs,
found in the Breviary on October 14. No commemorations are made because it is a
votive office\footnote{The office \textit{Dedicationis Ecclesi\ae} cannot be
recited on this occasion --- \src, Dec. 7, 1844, n. 2868. Neither does the
recitation of the office \textit{Sanctorum Martyrum} on this occasion dispense
from the recitation of the current office. The axiom \textit{``Officium pro
officio valet''} cannot here be applied. --- \src, Sept. 16, 1881, n. 3532 ad
II.}.

\rubric During the night two candles should be kept burning before the
relics.\footnote{It is not necessary to repeat Matins and Lauds so that the
watch be kept throughout the night --- \src, Feb. 22, 1888, n. 3686 ad III.}
Martinucci says that in Rome two, four or six lay persons continue the watch
until the relics are carried to the church on the following morning.

\chap{Consecration of the Church}{

\section{Notes.}

\rubric The Consecrator may recite or sing the Orations\footnote{The rubrics
use the terms \textit{dicit, dicens}.}; if he sings them he used the
\textit{tonus ferialis.} The same rule applies for the Preface.

\rubric The antiphons, responsories, psalms\footnote{Except the seven
Penitential Psalms at the beginning of the function, which are recited
\textit{recto tono}.} and Litany ought to be sung\footnote{The rubrics say
\textit{cantat, cantant, schola seu ministris prosequentibus}.} unless
\textit{ob defunctum cantorum} it is impssible to do so, in which case they
should be recited \textit{recto tono.} 

\rubric The cross-bearer and acolytes should stand opposite to the Consecrator,
except when they lead the procession and when the Consecrator is engaged at the
altar, in which case they stand \textit{in plano} on the Gospel side; they
always accompany the Consecrator when moving from one altar to another.

\rubric The miter and crosier bearers always stand or move behind the Consecrator.

\section{From the Beginning to the Blessing of the Water.}

\rubric The function ought to be begun at an early hour. All who are to take
part in the ceremony enter the sacristy or church. Subdeacon and Deacon vest in
amice, alb and cincture, the Deacon dons a white stole. The
Deacon\footnote{Referred to in these notes as the ``Guard''.} who is to guard
the church vests in the same manner as the officiating Deacon.

\rubric The laity are not permitted into the church, and all doors but the main
doors are locked. Deacon and Subdeacon flank the faldstool, which stands in the
middle of the church, facing the main doors. Cross-bearer and acolytes stand
near the Deacon, facing the doors. Assisting clergy in surplice and the Guard
go to the entrance and receive the Bishop, in the mantelletta, who is lead
immediately to the faldstool. The Bishop sits and orders the twelve crosses to
be lighted. The clergy arrange themselves in rows behind and on the sides of
the faldstool.

\rubric As soon as the candles have been lighted all go to the place where the
relics were kept overnight:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Cross-bearer and acolytes;

    \item Chanters\footnote{If the chanters are not vested in cassock and
        surplice they precede the cross-bearer. See \cite{consecranda} Note 2,
        p. 31.} and clergy, two by two;

    \item Bishop between Deacon and Subdeacon;

    \item The Bishop's attendants

\end{enumerate}

As soon as the procession has left the church the main doors are locked and
only the Gaurd is left in the church.

\rubric Upon arrival, CB and ACs stand to the Gospel side of the table, facing
the Epistle side; the clerics and priests stand in rows before the altar;
chanters go to the lectern. Bishop and minsters go to the altar and kneel before the
relics a short time in prayer; all kneel with them.

\rubric MC1 signals all to rise; Bishop goes to faldstool and sits down with
biretta, facing the door of the chapel, Deacon and Subdeacon flanking. Once
the Bishop is seated MC2 distributes vestments to the clergy who will vest the
Bishop; the clergy approach the faldstool and stand a short distance from it.
Book- and candle-bearers take Pontifical and candle and stand behind the Bishop
and to his left. Servers stand by ready with ewer, basin and towel.

\rubric MC1 signals the Bishop to remove biretta, rise and turn towards the
relics; Deacon and Subdeacon switch sides. The Bishop \textit{reads} in a loud tone
\textit{Ne reminiscaris}, after which chanters and clergy slowly
\textit{recite} the seven Pentitential Psalms.

\rubric The Bishop sits immediately after reading \textit{Ne reminiscaris.} The
Deacon removes the Bishop's pectoral cross and mantelletta. The Bishop dons
biretta and his hands are washed, altar-boys standing.\footcite[See][note 1, p.
39.]{consecranda}

\rubric After the hand-washing, the Deacon takes biretta and the vesters
approach the Bishop, who stands. Deacon and Subdeacon vest the Bishop in amice,
alb, cincture, pectoral cross, white stole and cope. The Deacon imposes
miter\footnote{It seems that Bishop should be sitting at this time, since he
does not normally receive the miter at the faldstool while standing.} and the
Bishop receives crosier. The Bishop sits with the Deacon and the Subdeacon and
they read alternately\footcite[The bishop usually reads the first verse of each
psalm and recites the verse \textit{Gloria Patri.}][note 3, p.
39.]{consecranda} the seven penitential psalms. Once the chanters have finished
the seventh psalm, the Bishop alone repeats \textit{Ne reminiscaris.}

\rubric After the antiphon has been repeated all go to the main doors of the
church:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Cross-bearer and acolytes;

    \item Chanters, two by two;\footnote{If the chanters are not vested in
        cassock and surplice they precede the cross-bearer.}

    \item Clergy two by two;

    \item Bishop between Deacon and Subdeacon;

    \item Miter and crosier, book (with \textit{Pontificale}) and candle
        bearers.

\end{enumerate}

Cross-bearer and acolytes stand at the right side of the entrance so that the
Bishop can see the cross; Chanters stand neaar the lectern; clergy and clerics
stand in semicircular rows; the Bishop stands with ministers in front of the
door, facing it.

\rubric Crosier and miter away. Bishop intones \textit{Adesto Deus unus} (these
three words only) which the chanters continue to the end. Bishop afterwards
says the oration \textit{Actiones nostras}. After the oration Bishop receives
miter and kneels before the faldstool. All kneel at their places during the
singing of the litany, which the chanters begin once Bishop kneels. The litany
is not doubled and \textit{all present} sing the responses. All rise after the
response \textit{Exaudi nos Domine} after the second \textit{Propitius esto.}

\section{Blessing of the Water.}

\rubric Bishop receives the crosier and goes to the large table accompanied by
ministers, miter, crosier, book and candle bearers. Bishop stands in such a way
that he faces the cross, to which he bows as often as he says \textit{Oremus}
or the Holy Name.

\rubric The Bishop exorcises the salt. The Bishop then gives crosier away,
Deacon removes miter and blesses the salt with his hands joined.

\rubric Bishop receives miter and crosier and exorcises the water.

\rubric Crosier away; the Deacon removes miter and Bishop blesses the water
with joined hands.

\rubric The Bishop takes a handful of the blessed salt and drops it three times
in the form of a cross into the water saying \textit{Commíxtio salis et aqu\ae\
páriter fiat: In nómine Pa\cross tris et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\
sancti. \rbar Amen.}

\rubric The Deacon hands a towel to the Bishop; afterwards the Bishop says with
folded hands the oration \textit{Deus, invíct\ae.}

\section{Blessing of the Exterior of the Church.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and returns with his ministers to the main
entrance where he stands facing the door. The server in charge of the holy
water transfers some of the water into the aspersorium and then stands to the
right of the Deacon. The Deacon removes miter and hands aspergil to the Bishop,
who intones \textit{Asperges me}, which is continued by the chanters. The
Bishop sprinkles himself, the clergy and the bystanders.

\rubric Cross-bearer and acolytes stand to the right of the Bishop, who resumes
miter. Cross-bearer and acolytes proceed Bishop and ministers around the
outside of the church, epistle side first. The Bishop sprinkles in the form of
a cross the \textit{upper part of the walls} of the church\footcite[The
procession walks around and Bishop sprinkles the cemetery also if it be
adjacent.][n. 41, p. 44.]{consecranda} saying continually: \textit{In nómine
Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti,} not adding the
word \textit{Amen}. The holy water bearer walks to the right of the Deacon and
the people may follow the Bishop.\footcite[If it is impossible to go around the
church, he sprinkles the wall at his right as far as he can, then, passing by
the front of the church, he goes to the place at the other side of the church
nearest the point at which he stoped on the right side and begins to sprinkle
the walls from that point until he arrives at the main portal.][note 2, p.
44.]{consecranda}

\rubric The chanters finish the antiphon and sing the resonsory
\textit{Asperges me}, which is sung while Bishop sprinkles the outside of the
church.

\rubric Having arrived back at the main entrance, the Bishop hands the aspergil
to the Bishop, who passes it to the water carrier.\footnote{The water carrier
ought to refill at this time.} The Deacon removes miter; cross-bearer and
acolytes stand at the right of the Bishop. When the chanters have finished
Bishop faces the door of the church says \textit{Orémus,} the Deacon adds
\textit{Flectámus génua,} and all make a simple genuflection.\footnote{Except
the cross-bearer, acolytes and book and candle bearers.} Then\footnote{The
subdeacon does not say \textit{Leváte} until everyone (or at least the bishop
and those close to him) achieved a genuflecting position.} Subdeacon says
\textit{Leváte} and all rise. Bishop says the oration \textit{Omnípotens
sempitérne Deus.}

\rubric The Bishop resumes miter and receives the crosier, strikes the door
\textit{once} with the lower end of the crosier and says:

\begin{quote}
    Attóllite portas príncipes vestras, et elevámini port\ae\ \ae ternáles: et
    introíbit Rex glóri\ae.
\end{quote}

The Guard from the inside of the church\footcite[The door may be slightly open,
so that the Bishop and the Guard can hear each other.][note 1, p.
46.]{consecranda} says in a loud tone:

\begin{quote}
   Quis est iste Rex Glóri\ae? 
\end{quote}

Bishop answers in the same tone:

\begin{quote}
    Dóminus fortis, et potens: Dóminus potens in pr\'\ae lio.
\end{quote}

% TODO: make the actions of the Bishop explicit in the rubrics

\rubric Bishop gives away crosier, receives sprinkler from Deacon and goes around the
church a second time, the same manner as before, but this time sprinkling the
\textit{lower part of the walls} of the church. As soon as Bishop begins this second
sprinkling chanters sing the responsory \textit{Benedic, Domine.}

\rubric Bishop returns to the main entrance and repeats the ceremonies performed
after his first circuit.

\rubric Bishop strikes the door as before and repeats the ceremonies as before.

\rubric For a third time, Bishop walks around the church, this time starting on the
\textit{left} side, sprinkling the wall at level of his face, chanters singing
the responsory \textit{Tu Domine.}

\rubric Bishop returns to the main entrance and repeats the ceremonies performed
after his first circuit.

\rubric Bishop strikes the door as before and repeats the ceremonies, this
time, after the Guard's interrogation, Bishop and all clergy answer:

\begin{quote}
    Dóminus virtútum ipse est Rex glóri\ae. Aperíte. Aperíte. Aperíte.
\end{quote}

\rubric Bishop makes with the lower part of the crosier the sign of the cross on the
threshold, saying \textit{Ecce cru\cross is signum, fugiant phantasmata
cuncta.} The door is then opened by the Guard. B, Deacon and Subdeacon enter the church and
Bishop says in a loud tone \textit{Pax huic domui,} to which the Guard answers
\textit{In introitu vestro,} and all the clergy answer \textit{Amen.}

\rubric The Guard goes to the sacristy and devests. Bishop moves to the right so
that CB and ACs, chanters, assistant clerics and mason enter the church, after
which the church is closed and locked.\footnote{The visiting clergy and the
people remain outside the church.} All in the church most in procession, CB and
ACs in the lead, Bishop and ministers in the rear, followed by the book, candle,
miter and crosier bearers, to the faldstool which stands in the middle of the
church. During the procession the chanters sing the antiphons \textit{Pax \ae
terna} and \textit{Zach\ae\ efestinans.}

\section{Blessing of the Interior of the Church.}

\rubric CB and ACs stand at the epistle side of the faldstool, chanters stand
at the lectern, Bishop with ministers stands before the faldstool, facing the high
altar, and all the others stand near B. Upon the completion of the antiphons, B
gives crosier to crosier-bearer and Deacon removes miter and zucchetto. MC1 signals
all to kneel on both knees and Bishop intones the \textit{Veni Creator Spiritus},
which is continued by the chanters. All rise at the end of the first strophe, D
replaces B's zucchetto, and remain standing until the end of the hymn.

\rubric At the beginning of the second strophe several assistants sprinkle the
floor the ashes in which the letters of the Latin and Greek alphabets are to be
delineated.\footnote{They may be sprinkles either in two lines going diagonally
though the church, or in forty-eight distinct squares. It will facilitate the
action of the bishop if the letters are formed beforehand with chalk on the
floor.}

\rubric After the singing of the \textit{Veni Creator Spiritus,} Bishop resumes
miter and kneels before the faldstool. All also kneel\footnote{Except for, of
course, the cross-bearer and acolytes, and the assistants sprinkling the ash.}
The chanters begin the litany, doubling the name (names) of the saint (saints)
in whose honor the church and the altar (altars) is consecrated and the names
of the martyrs whose relics are to be placed in the altar.\footcite[If the name
of any of these saints is inscried in the litany, e.g., St. Peter, St. Stephen,
it is invoked a second time immediately after the proper invocation in the
Litany. If the name is not in the Litany, it is inserted after the
\textit{individual} invocations of the saints of the same category, but before
the general invocation, e.g., if the church is consecrated in honor of St.
Francis de Sales, his name is inserted twice after \textit{Sancte Nicol\ae} and
before \textit{Omnes sancti Pontifices et Confessores.} If the church or altar
is consecrated in honor of the Blessed Virgin under any title whatever the
invocation \textit{Sancta Maria} is mentioned twice; if in honor of a mystery
of the Life and Passion of Our Lord, the petition \textit{Fili Redemptor mundi
Deus} is repeated.][Note, p. 51.]{consecranda}

\rubric The MC2 gets the Chart 1. After the chanters have sung \textit{Ut
omnibus fidelibus defunctis,} etc., and those present have answered \textit{Te
rogamus audi nos} B, D, Subdeacon and crosier-bearer rise. Bishop receives crosier and
recites, using Chart 1, held by the subdeacon, alternately with all present:

\begin{quote}
    \vbar Ut locum istum visitáre dignéris.\\
    \rbar Te rogámus audi nos.\\
    \vbar Ut in eo Angelórum custódiam deputáre dignéris.\\
    \rbar Te rogámus audi nos.\\
\end{quote}

Bishop then raises his right hand and blesses the altar (altars) and church
conjointly by making the sign of the cross towards the atlar as often as
indicated in the invocations that follow. Deacon raises the border of B's cope
whenever Bishop makes the sign of the cross. After the petitions, Bishop gives away cross
and he and all who rose with him kneel and the Litany is sung to the last
\textit{Kyrie eleison.}

\rubric Ater the Litany, all rise; Deacon removes miter. \textit{Oremus. Flectámus
génua. Leváte.} Bishop facing the altar says the two orations \textit{Pr\ae véniat
nos} and \textit{Magnificáre.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and receives the crosier. CB and ACs lead Bishop and
ministers to the corner at the gospel side of the main entrance. With the lower
extremity of the crosier, which is held in both hands, Bishop delineates the letters
of the Greek alphabet in the ashes spread on the floor from this corner to the
epistle corner of the church near the altar. Then he goes to the corner at the
epistle side of the main entrance and delineates in the same manner the letters
of the Latin alphabet in the ashes spread on the floor from this corner to the
gospel corner of the church near the altar.

CB and ACs stand opposite Bishop and move with him along the line. As soon as B
begins the Greek alphabet the chanters sing the \textit{Canticle of Zachary,}
the verses alternating with antiphons. The chanters take care that the antiphon
after the \textit{Sicut erat} will be sung when the bishop is writing the last
letters of the Latin alphabet. When the cantor notices that Bishop is approaching
the last letters of the Latin alphabet, he instructs the chanters to break off
singing the canticle and to begin the \textit{Gloria Patri.}\footcite[][p.
56.]{consecranda}

\rubric When Bishop has finished writing the Latin alphabet he goes with his
assistants, preceded by CB and ACs, to the altar which is to be consecrated,
and, standing a few paces from it, lays aside the crosier and miter. He then
kneels, all others kneeling with him, facing the altar, and says:

\begin{quote}
    \vbar Deus in adjutórium meum inténde.
\end{quote}

Bishop and all the others rise and the chanters say:

\begin{quote}
    \rbar Dómine ad adjuvándum me festína.
\end{quote}

Bishop standing in the same place and without miter says:

\begin{quote}
    \vbar Glória Patri, et Fílio, et Spirítui sancto.
\end{quote}

To which the chanters answer:

\begin{quote}
    \rbar Sicut erat in princípio, et nunc, et semper, et in s\'\ae cula s\ae
    culórum. Amen.
\end{quote}

This ceremony is performed three times, commencing in a higher tone each time,
the chanters answering each time in the same tone as B. All present kneel and
rise with B. 

\section{Blessing of the Gregorian Water.}

\rubric After the \textit{Sicut erat} has been recited the third time Bishop resumes the
miter and receives the crosier, and goes with assistants, preceded by CB and
ACs, to the table on which the water, ashes, salt and wine are kept. CB and ACs
stand on the opposite side of the table as B, facing him. Bishop retains miter and
crosier and exorcises the salt. Bishop then lays aide the crosier, miter is removed
and he blesses the salt.

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and crosier and exorcises the water; then he lays aside
the crosier and miter and blesses the water. 

\rubric Without miter or crosier, Bishop blesses the ashes.

\rubric With his right hand he takes a handful of the salt and drops it on the
ashes three times in the form of a cross, saying:

\begin{quote}
   Commíxtio salis et cíneris páriter fiat. In nómine Pa\cross tris, et
    Fí\cross lii et Spíritus\cross sancti. \\
   \rbar Amen.
\end{quote}

Bishop mixes the salt and ashes with his right hand. Bishop then takes a handful of this
mixture and drops it into the water \textit{one} time\footcite[The Pontifical
seems to indicate that the bishop performs this ceremony \textit{three times,}
but the authors imply that it is done only \textit{once.}][footnote 1, p.
60.]{consecranda} in the form of a cross saying:

\begin{quote}
    Commíxtio salis, cíneris, et aqu\ae\ páriter fiat. In nómine Pa\cross tris,
    et Fí\cross lii et Spíritus\cross sancti. \\
   \rbar Amen.
\end{quote}

D hands Bishop a towel with which he wipes his hand.

\rubric Bishop then without miter or crosier, blesses the wine. He then takes the
cruet of wine in his right hand and pours the wine intot he water three times
in the form of a cross saying:

\begin{quote}
    Commíxtio vini, salis, cíneris, et aqu\ae\ páriter fiat. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii et Spíritus\cross sancti. \\
   \rbar Amen.
\end{quote}

Bishop then recites the oration that follows.

\rubric Bishop resumes the miter and says the prayer \textit{Santcti\cross ficáre}
over the water.

\rubric Bishop receives crosier and goes the the main door of the church accompanied
by Deacon and Subdeacon and predeced by CB and ACs. With the lower extremity of the
crosier, Bishop makes a cross on the inner side of the dorr on the upper part and
another cross on the lower part. He then gives away the crosier and, retaining
the miter and facing the door, he says the prayer \textit{Sit pósitis crux.}

\rubric Bishop receives crosier and returns to the table on which the water was
blessed. Bishop gives the crosier to the crosier-bearer and with the miter, facing
the altar, says the invitatory \textit{Deum Patrem omnipoténtem.}

While Bishop recites this invitatory a cleric fills the aspersorium with the
Gregorian water and goes to the epistle corner of the altar to be consecrated.
He takes a towel with him as well. MC2 takes Chart 2 to the gospel corner of
the altar.

}

\chap{Consecration of the Altar}{

\section{Sprinkling of the Altar.}

\rubric Bishop takes crosier and goes to the altar which is to be consecrated. At
the foot of the altar he gives away his crosier and ascends the predella where
he intones the antiphon \textit{Introibo ad altare Dei}(these four words only),
which is continued by the chanters. After the antiphon the chanters sing the
psalm \textit{Judica me Deus,} and \textit{if necessary} they repeat the
antiphon \textit{Introibo} after each verse of this psalm.\footcite[The rubric
after the first verse of this psalm says that the antiphon should be repeated
after each verse \textit{si necesse fuerit.} The necessity would arise if
\textit{several} altars were bering consecrated at the same time for the object
of the repetition seems to be that the chant should continue as long as the
function. If only \textit{one} altar is consecrated, the antiphon is repeated
only at the end of the psalm instead of the \textit{Gloria Patri,} etc.,
\textit{which is omitted.} The same is the case with the psalms that
follow.][footnote 1, p. 64.]{consecranda} The \textit{Gloria Patri} is omitted
and the antiphon \textit{Introibo} is repeated in its place.

\rubric After intoning \textit{Introibo} Bishop dips the thumb of his right hand
into the Gregorian water and makes with it the sign of the cross on the table
of the altar in the middle when he pronounces the word \textit{Sanctificetur},
and then raising his right hand he makes the sign of the cross over the pace
which he signed with his thumb three times at the end:

\begin{quote}
    Sancti\cross ficétur hoc altáre, in honórem Dei omnipoténtis, et
    gloriós\ae\ Vírginis Marí\ae, atque ómnium Sanctórum, et ad nomen ac
    memóriam Sancti N. (\textit{Santórum N. N.}). In nómine Pa\cross tris, et
    Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti. Pax tibi. 
\end{quote}

\rubric Deacon receives the aspersorium from the cleric and holds it before B, and
SD holds before Bishop Chart 2 which contains the above formula. Having performed
this rite  on the cneter of the mensa, Bishop repeats it with the same ceremonies
and the same formula successively at the posterior corner of the gospel side,
the anterior corner of the epistle side, the anterior corner of the gospel side
and the posterior corner of the epistle side.

\crossplan

D receives the towel from the cleric and hand it to the bishop who dries his
thumb with it, after which Bishop hands towel back to Deacon who hadns it and the
aspersorium to the cleric. MC2 receives Chart 2 from Subdeacon.

\rubric Bishop goes to the middle of the altar and remians standing on the predella.
When the chanters have repeated the antiphons after the psalm, miter removed.
\textit{Oremus; Flectámus genua; Leváte.} Afterwards Bishop says the prayer
\textit{Singuláre.}

During this prayer the cleric carries thte towel to the table and refills the
aspersorium with the Gregorian water and returns to the right of D. MC2 carries
Cart 2 to the mensa.

\rubric Bishop intons the antiphon \textit{Asperges me} (these two words only) which
the chanters continue to the end, after which they sing the first three verses
of the psalm \textit{Miserere.} After intoning, Bishop resumes miter, receives the
aspergil from Deacon and sprinkles the support and mensa conjointly. Bishop begins in
front at the middle of the altar, proceeds to the epistle side, passes behind
the altar and returns by the gospel side to the iddle at the front of the
altar. Bishop is accompanied by D, Subdeacon and AC with aspersorium.\footcite[If the back
part of the altar is attached to the wall, so that the bishop cannot go around
it, he sprinkles only the \textit{base} of the base of the altar when passing
from the middle to the epistle corner, then the epistle side of the altar,
afterwards the table of the altar from the epistle corner to the gospel corner,
then the gospel side of the altar and finaly the \textit{base} in front of the
altar from the gospel corner to the middle.][footnote, p. 68.]{consecranda}

\textsc{Note. ---} If the support at any part of the atlar consists only of
columns, then only the columns are sprinkled.\footcite[][p. 68.]{consecranda}

\rubric Having arrived at the center of the altar, Bishop waits until the chanters
have sung the third verse of the \textit{Miserere,} after which he intones a
second time the antiphon \textit{Asperges me} and sprinkles the altar as
before, while the chanters sing the antiphon and the next three verses of the
\textit{Miserere.}

\rubric The altar is sprinkled seven times in this manner. Before each
sprinkling Bishop intones the \textit{Asperges me,} which the chanters continue,
after which they sing three verses of the psalm \textit{Miserere,} except at
the seventh sprinkling, when only two verses are sung.

\begin{tabular}{l l}
    \toprule
    Sprinkling & Beginning of the three verses \\
    \midrule
    First & \textit{Miserére mei Deus} \\
    Second & \textit{Quóniam iniquitátem meam} \\
    Third & \textit{Ecce enim vertátem} \\
    Fourth & \textit{Avérte fáciem tuam} \\
    Fifth & \textit{Redde mihi l\ae títiam} \\
    Sixth & \textit{Dómine, lábia mea apéries} \\
    Seventh & \textit{Benígne fac Dómine} \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

The \textit{Glória Patri} is not sung.

\section{Sprinkling of the Walls and Floor.}

\rubric At the middle of the altar, after the seventh sprinkling, Bishop descends
from the predella to the foot of the altar. Proceeded by CB and ACs,
accompanied by D, Subdeacon and AC with aspersorium, Bishop goes behind the altar. Once
chanters begin the \textit{H\ae c est domus} Bishop begins to sprinkle the lower
part of the wall, commencing at the middle behind the altar and then, preceded
by the CB and ACs, he passes donw the \textit{gospel} side and returns by the
\textit{epistle} side and finishes at the point behind the altar where he
began. Chanters meanwhile sing \textit{H\ae c est domus} and the psalm
\textit{L\ae tátus sum}; no \textit{Glória Patri} and the antiphon is not
repeated.

\rubric As soon as the chanters have finished \textit{L\ae tatus sum} they
begin to sing the antiphon \textit{Exsurgat Deus} and the psalm \textit{In
ecclesiis,} Bishop goes around the inside of the church a second time in the manner
described above and sprinkles the midle part\footnote{\textit{circa altitudinem
faciei su\ae}} of the wall. No \textit{Glória Patri} after the psalm and the
antiphon is not repeated.

\rubric As soon as the chanters have finished \textit{In ecclesiis} they sing
the antiphon \textit{Qui habitat} and the psalm \textit{Dict Domino,} Bishop goes
around the inside of the church beginning in the middle behind the altar,
passes this time down the \textit{epistle} side and returns by the
\textit{gospel} side, and finishes at the point behind the altar where he
began. He sprinkles the upper part of the wall. No \textit{Glória Patri} after
the psalm and the antiphon is not repeated.

\rubric Bishop returns to the foot of the altar. When chanters intone the antiphon
\textit{Domus mea} B, preceded by CB and ACs and accompanied by D, Subdeacon and
server with the Gregorian water, goes from the altar to the mian door of the
church sprinkling the floor; then he goes to the middle fo thewall at the
gospel side and passes in a direct line to the middle of the wall on the
epistle side likewise sprinkling the floor; after which Bishop goes the the center
of the church.

\rubric Having reached the center of the church Bishop stands facing the altar and
when the chanters have finished the antiphon \textit{Non est hic,} Bishop intones
the antiphon \textit{Vidit Jacob scalam} (these three words only), which the
chanters sing to the end. Having intoned this antiphon he sprinkles the floor
towards the East, the West, the North and the South.\footcite[The Rubric in the
\textit{Pontificale Romanum} supposes the altar to be towards the East; the
bishop, therefore, sprinkles the floor before him, behind him, at his left and
than at his right.][footnote 1, p. 74.]{consecranda}

\rubric After the atniphon the miter is removed; Bishop turns towards the door of
the church. \textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua; Leváte.} Bishop says the prayer
\textit{Deus, qui loca.}

\rubric Bishop still facing the door: \textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua; Leváte.} B
says the prayer \textit{Deus sanctificatiónum}, inserting the name of the saint
(saints) whose name the church will bear is inserted.

\rubric B, facing the door, recites with hands extended at his breast the
Preface, in which after N. he inserts the name of the saint (saints) whose name
the church will bear.

\textsc{Note. ---} During the Preface the priests, who will carry the holy
relics to the church, go to the place where the relics are exposed and put on
amice, alb, cincture and red chasuble. Torches are prepared for the procession
and the thurifer prepares the thurible.

Bishop adds the conclusion in a low tone of voice, loud enough to be head by those
near him.

\rubric After the Preface Bishop resumes miter and, accompanied by his assistants,
goes to the foot of the altar to bless the \textit{dry} cement\footcite[The
Pontifical prescrives that he should first mix the cement with the water which
he previously blessed and then bless the mixture. This is not feasible and
consequently it is better to keep sufficient amount of water in a separate
vessel to be poured over the dry cement shortly before it is to be used for
closing the sepulchre.][footnote, p. 77.]{consecranda} contained in a dish,
which a server holds before B. Miter removed, Bishop reads the oration \textit{Summe
Deus.}

After this the Gregorian water, except that which is reserved for preparing the
cement, is poured around the base of the altar.\footcite[If much water remains
only a small quantity of it is poured around the base of the altar, and what is
left is afterwards poured into the \textit{secrarium.}][footnote 1, p.
78.]{consecranda}

\section{Bringing of the Holy Relics to the Church.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and crosier and all go in procession to the place where
the relics are exposed, in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item CB and ACs;
    \item Chanters\footnote{If the chanters are not vested in cassock and
        suplice they precede the cross-bearer.}
    \item Clergy, two by two;
    \item Server carrying the vase of Chrism and some absorbent cotton on a
        salver;\footnote{Cotton sheets (woven and unwoven) are superior to
        cotton balls in this case.}
    \item B, between Deacon and Subdeacon;
    \item Miter, crosier, book an candle-bearers.
\end{enumerate}

The procession passes through the main entrace of the church. The server
carrying the Chrism remains at the door. A server lights the candles on the
table outside the main entrance and on the table inside the church on which the
relics are to be placed. All others go to the oratory where the relics are
exposed.

\rubric All reamins standing outside the oratory. Bishop gives crosier to the
crosier-bearer and his miter is removed. \textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua;
Leváte.} Bishop recites \textit{Aufer a nobis.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and crosier. The procession moves into the oratory,
while the chanters sing several antiphons and the psalm \textit{Venite
exultemus;} the \textit{Glória Patri} is not sung. Instead of the prescribed
antiphons and the psalm \textit{Venite exultemus,} a Respontory proper of the
martyrs whose relics are exposed, or one taken from the \textit{Commune
Plurimorum SS. Martyrum} may be sung.

\rubric After the psalm of responsory B's miter is removed. \textit{Orémus;
Flectámus génua; Leváte.} Bishop recites the prayer \textit{Fac nos, qu\ae sumus.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter, imposes incense with the usual ceremonies.
Meanwhile lighted torches are distributed among the clergy. Bishop intones the
antiphon \textit{Cum jucunditate} (these two words only) and the chanters
continue this antiphon and sing the three others that follow, while the relics
are carried in procession to the church in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item CB and ACs;
    \item Chanters;
    \item Priests carrying lighted torches;
    \item TH swinging the censer before the relics;
    \item Two or Four Priests vested in red chasubles carrying the relics on a
        bier;\footcite[Instead of these priets the consecrator may carry the
        relics on s salver.][footnote 1, p. 81.]{consecranda}
    \item Bishop with miter and crosier between Deacon and Subdeacon;
    \item Miter, Crosier, Book and Candle bearers;
    \item Laity.
\end{enumerate}

When the procession arrives at the door of the church the chanters remain there
and continue the chanting of the antiphons, whilst all the others, in the order
above, go around the outside of the church beginning at the right (epistle)
side, passing around the rear, and returning to the door by the left (gospel)
side, saying continually \textit{Kyrie eléison\dots}

\rubric When the procession returns to the front of the church the cros-bearer
and the acolytse take their places at the left side of the door and the relics
are placed on the table prepared for them. The priests who carried the relics
in the procession, the thurifer and the clergy carrying torches, arrange
themselves around this table in such a manner that the relics may be seen by
the bihsop when sitting on the faldstool placed at the right side of the door.
When the bishop arrives at the door he gives his crosier to the crosier-bearer
and sits on the faldstool, after which he may give an exhortation to the
people.\footcite[The exhortation here spoken of, the decrees of the Council of
Trent which according to the Pontifical are now read by the archdeacon (any
priest), the address of the Bishop to the founder of the church and the
latter's reply may be omitted. --- \src, May 17, 1890, n. 3729 ad
VIII.][footnote 2, p. 82.]{consecranda}

\rubric The bishop remains sitting while the chanters sing the responsory
\textit{Erit mihi.}

\rubric When this responsory is finished the miter is removed and the bishop
rises and turns towards the door. \textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua; Leváte.} B
reads the prayer \textit{Domum tuam.}

\rubric The bishop resumes miter. Deacon and Subdeacon holding the border of
his cope, the Bishop goes to the right side of the door. He dips his thumb into
the Chrism and anoints three times the sotne pillar at the place where the
cross is scuptured,\footcite[The Pontifical says ''\textit{signat ostium,''}
which the \src, Aug. 7, 1875, n. 3364 ad VI, interprets to mean the two stone
or brick pillars at the sides of the door.][footnote 1, p. 83.]{consecranda}
saying:

\begin{quote}
   In nomine Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spirítus \cross Sancti.
\end{quote}

He then goes to the left side of the door and in the same manner anoints three
times with Chrism the stone pillar at the place where the cross is sculptured.
After wiping his thumb in cotton he goes to the middle of the door says the
prayer \textit{Porta sis.}

\rubric The Bishop goes to the faldstool and standing intones the antiphon
\textit{Ingredimini sancti Dei} (these three words only) which the chanters
continue to the end and then add the second antiphon \textit{Gaudent in c\oe
lis.} After his intonation, the Bishop receives his crosier and all enter the
church in the order given above and proceed to the altar which is to be
consecrated. The people are now allowed to enter the church. Cross-bearer and
Acolytes stand at the gospel side, and the chanters at the lectern on the
gospel side, and the clergy carrying torches in a semicircle around the altar.
The priests who carry the relics place the bier on the table prepared for them
and remain standing near the table. The Bishop and his assitants stand before
the altar in the middle of the sanctuary.

\rubric The Bishop lays aside his crosier and intones the antiphon
\textit{Exultabunt sancti} (these two words only) which the chantesr contineu,
and to which they add the psalms \textit{Cantate Domino} and \textit{Laudate
Dominum.} The \textit{Gloria Patri} is not said and the antiphon is repated
after the second psalm. Meanwhile a server places on the altar near the center
on the epistle side the small stock containing the Chrism and the slab of stone
which is to be placed over the sepulchre after the case containing the relics
has been placed in it, and MC2 places Chart 3 (formula of consecration) on the
gospel side.

\section{Placing of the Holy Relics in the Sepulchre.}

\rubric While the antiphon \textit{Exsultabunt} is being repeated, the Bishop
and his assitants ascend to the predella, where the Deacon removes the miter.
After the antiphon the Bishop facing the altar says the prayer \textit{Deus,
qui in omni loco.}

\rubric The Bishp resumes his miter and anoints each of the four corners of the
sepulchre on the inside, reciting while anointing each corner:

\begin{quote}
    Conse\cross crétur et sancti\cross ficétur hoc sepúlcrum. In nómine
    Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti. Pax huic dómui.
\end{quote}

\textsc{Note. ---} The Bishop anoints each corner \textit{twice,} i.e., once at
the word \textit{Consecretur} and again at the word \textit{Sanctificetur.} He
then reaises his right hand and makes the sign of the cross three times over
the corner just anointed, i.e., at the wrods \textit{Patris, Filii} and
\textit{Spiritus sancti.}

\rubric Afterwards the Bishop wipes his thumb with cotton, his miter is removed
and he turns towards the people, receding a little to the gospel side but
remaining on the predella. The Priests who carried the relics in the procession
carry the bier and urn containing the relics to the Bishop. The Deacon opens
the urn and the Bishop takes out with both hands the case containing the
relics, and turning towards the altar, places the case into the sepulchre while
intoning the antiphon \textit{Sub altare Dei} (these three words only) which
the chanters continue to the end.

The bier and urn are carried back to the table by the four priests mentioned
above. The candles on this table are extinguished and the four priests go to
the sacristy and divest.

In the meantime the mason mixes in a dish the blessed cement with the Gregorian
water set aside for this purpose.

\rubric During the antiphon \textit{Sub altare Dei} the Bishp imposes incense
and incenses the relics with three swings, bowing profoundly before and
afterwards. The Bishop resumes his miter, takes in his left hand the small slab
that is to cover the sepulchre, dips his right thumb into the Chrism and
anoints bottom of the slab in the same manner as he anointed the crosses,
saying:

\begin{quote}
    Conse\cross crétur et sancti\cross ficétur h\ae c tábula, per istam
    untiónem et Dei benedictiónem. In nómine Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et
    Spíritus \cross\ sancti. Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

\rubric The Bishop then places the slap on the altar (not over the sepulchre)
and wipes his thumb with cotton. The dish containing the prepared cement is now
brought to the altar and with a small trowel the Bishop spreadst the cement
over the ledge on the inside of the sepulchre.\footcite[The bishop may be
assisted by the mason, and care should be taken that the cement does not fall
on the sack containing the relics.][footnote 1, p. 89.]{consecranda} The Bishop
now takes the slab in his hand, intones the antiphon \textit{Sub altare Dei}
and places the slab over the opening of the sepulchre. The chanters continue
the antiphon \textit{Sub altare Dei audivi,} to which they add, if necessary,
the antiphon \textit{Corpora sanctorum.}

\rubric As soon as the chanters have finished the antiphons the Bishop removes
his miter and says the oration \textit{Deus, qui ex ómnium.} Miter resumed, the
Bishop \textit{begins} to fill with cement the crevices around the small slab,
which the mason may continue and finish. If any cement remain on the altar, it
is removed with a sponge or rough trowel.\footnote{A damp sponge is better for
this, as both a dry sponge and a rough trowel will tend to scratch the surface
of the altar.} The torches carried by the clergy are extinguished. The Bishop
dips his thumb in the Chrism and anoints once the top of the slab and the
altar\footcite[Martinucci, Hartmann, etc., say that the cross should be made
not only on the slab, but also on the portions of the table of the altar near
the slab as indicated by the cut.][footnote 1, p. 90.]{consecranda} in the
manner in which he anointed the four corners of the sepulchre, saying:

\begin{quote}
    Signé\cross tur et sancti\cross ficétur hoc altáre. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti. Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

The Bishop then wipes his thumb with cotton. The Deacon gives the Chrism to the
server and the Subdeacon gives Chart 3 to MC2.

The Chrism is carried to the credence. The cotton used by the Bishop and the
sponge or towel used in removing the cement from the altar, as well as the
scrapings of the cement, are thrown into the vessel prepared for this purpose
behind the altar.

\section{Incensation of the Altar.}

\rubric Incense is imposed at the altar in the usual manner, the Bishop saying:

\begin{quote}
   Ab illo benedicáris, in cujus honóre cremáberis. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti. \rbar Amen.
\end{quote}

The Miter is removed. The Deacon hands the thurible to the Bishop, who intones
the antiphon \textit{Stetit Angelus} (these two words only). The miter is
resumed and the Bihsop incenses the altar to the right, to the left, in front
and over the table until the chanters have finished the antiphon.

\rubric The Bishop give the thurible to the Deacon, and, miter removed,
standing on the predella in the middle of the altar, says the prayer
\textit{Dirigátur orátio nostra.} The Bishop resumes the miter and goes with
his attendants to the faldstool, placed \textit{in plano} at the epistle corner
of the steps of the altar, and sits.

\rubric Two priests, deacons or subdeacons, bested in suplice, wipe with
sponges the altar and its base, and then dry these places with rough towels.
The sponges and towels are afterwards placed in a large vase behind the altar.
After the function they are washed and the water of this washing is poured into
the sacrarium.

A server carrying Chart 4 containg the formula used at the following unctions
will stand \textit{in plano} at the gospel side, and another cleric carrying a
salver with the Oil of Catechumens and some cotton will stand \textit{in plano}
at the epistle side. The priest\footnote{From now on, referred to as the
\textit{incensing priest.}}, vested in surplice, whose duty it will be to
incense the altar during the consecration will stand near the server with the
holy oil.

\rubric When the altar has been wiped and dried, the Bishop, still sitting,
imposes and blesses incense in the usual manner. He then rises, ascends the
predella, receives the thurible from the Deacon and, saying nothing, incenses
in the form of a cross the table of the altar \textit{once}: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item in the middle,
    \item at the posterior corner of the gospel side,
    \item at the anterior corner of the epistle side,
    \item at the anterior corner of the gospel side,
    \item at the posterior corner of the epistle side.
\end{enumerate}

\crossplan

\rubric The Deacon takes the thurible from the Bishop and hands it to the
thurifer. The Bishop imposes incense in the usual manner. The Bishop again
receive the thurible from the Deacon and intones the responsory
\textit{Dirigatur} (this word only), which the chanters continue to the end.
During the chant of this responsory the Bishop goes around the altar
\textit{three times} incensing continuously the support and the table together.
He begins each time at the middle, proceeds to the epistle corner, then behind
the altar, and, passing by the gospel corner, returns to the middle in
front.\footcite[If the back of the altar is attached to the wall, he begins at
the middle, incenses the support as fas as the epistle corner, afterwards the
table from the epistle to the gospel side, then the side of the altar at the
gospel side, then the side of the altar at the gospel corner and finally the
support from the gospel corner to the middle.][footnote 1, p. 96.]{consecranda}

\rubric After the third incensation, the Incensing Priest will go the the
predella, receive the thurible from the Bishop with the usual kisses, descend
\textit{in planum} at the middle and when the Bishop has intoned the antiphon
\textit{Erexit Jacob} he will begin to incense the altar with \textit{single}
swings. He begins at the middle, proceeds to the epistle corner, goes behind
the altar and returns to the front of the altar by the gospel side, walking
always \textit{in plano.} This he does continuously, except when the Bishop
uses the thurible in the course of the consecration.

\section{Anointing of the Altar.}

\rubric The Bishop, having given the thurible to the Incensing Priest, intones
the antiphon \textit{Erexit Jacob} (these two words only) which the chanters
continue and to which they add the psalm \textit{Quam dilecta.}\footcite[The
rubric appplied to psalm 42 above applied here as well.]{consecranda} The
\textit{Gloria Patri} is not added. The antiphon is repeated after the psalm.

\rubric While the bishop is intoning the antiphon \textit{Erexit Jacob} the
server at the gospel side gives Chart 4 to the Subdeacon who holds it before
the Bishop, and the server at the epistle side give the \textit{Oleum
Catechumenorum} to the Deacon. A server holding a slaver with cotton balls
stands at the right of the deacon. After intoning the antiphon the Bishop
anoints with the \textit{Oleum Catechumenorum} the table of the altar in the
form of a cross in the middle and at the four corners in the following order:

\crossplan

pronouncing the following form at \textit{each} unction:

\begin{quote}
    Sancti\cross ficétur et conse\cross crétur lapis iste. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti: in honórem Dei, et
    gloriós\ae\ Vírginis Marí\ae, atque ómnium Sanctórum: ad nomen, et memóriam
    Sancti N. (\textit{Sanctórum N.N.}). Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

At each unction the Bishop makes the sign of the cross with his thumb twice,
i.e., at the words \textit{Sanctificetur} and \textit{Consecretur,} then
raising his right hand he blesses it three times, i.e., at the words
\textit{Patris, Filii} and \textit{Spiritus sancti.} At the letter \textit{N.}
in the formula he inserts the name (\textit{names}) of the saint
(\textit{saints}) to whom the altar is dedicated. During this ceremony the
Deacon and Subdeacon hold the borders of the Bishop's cope. After the last
unction the bishop wipes his thumb with cotton, and the Deacon and Subdeacon
give the \textit{Oleum Catechumenorum} and Chart 4 to the servers.

\textsc{Note. ---} Another thurible may be prepared for the incensation, which
is to follow, and given to the priest who incenses the altar.

\rubric Towards the end of the psalm \textit{Quam dilecta} the Bishop imposes
incense into the thurible presented to him by the Incensing Priest, blessing
the incense in the usual manner. As soon as the chanters have repeated the
antiphon \textit{Erexit Jacob} the Incensing Priest hands the thurible to the
Bishop. The Bishop intones the responsory \textit{Dirigatur} (this word only)
and the chanters continue it to the end.

In the meantime the Bishop incesnes the altar in teh manner described above,
going around the altar only \textit{once} by the epistle side and returning by
the gospel side.

\rubric Having arrived at the middle in front the Bishop gives the thurible to
the Incensing Priest, who continues the incensation of the altar as before. At
the end of the responsory the Bishop's miter is removed. \textit{Orémus;
Flectámus génua; Leváte.} The Bishop recites the prayer \textit{Adsit, Dómine.}

\rubric The Bishop intones the antiphon \textit{Mane surgens Jacob} (these
three words only) which the chanters continue and to which the add the psalm
\textit{Bonum est.} The \textit{Gloria Patri} is not added and the antiphon is
repeated. The Bishop resumes his miter after the intonation and anoints the
altar a second time with the \textit{Oleum Catechumenorum} in the same manner
as described above, reciting the following formula from Chart 4.

\begin{quote}
    Sancti\cross ficétur et conse\cross crétur lapis iste. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti: in honórem Dei, et
    gloriós\ae\ Vírginis Marí\ae, atque ómnium Sanctórum: ad nomen, et memóriam
    Sancti N. (\textit{Sanctórum N.N.}). Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

During this ceremony the Deacon and Subdeacon will hold the borders of the

and \textit{Omnípotens\dots altáre hoc.}

\rubric After these prayers the server hadns the vessel containing the Chrism
to the Deacon and the Bishop intones the antiphon \textit{Unxit te Deus} (these
three words only), which the chanters continue and to which they add the psalm
\textit{Eructávit cor meum.}\footcite[The antiphon \textit{Unxit te Deus} may
be repested after each verse of this psalm.][footnote 1, p. 104.]{consecranda}
The \textit{Gloria Patri} is not said and the antiphon is repeated.

After intoning the antiphon the Bishop resumes him miter and then anoints the

noster refúgium.}\footcite[The antiphon \textit{Sanctificávit Dóminus} may be
repeated after each verse of this psalm.][footnote 1, p. 108.]{consecranda} The
\textit{Glória Patri} is not said and the antiphon is repeated.

\rubric Having intoned the antiphon \textit{Sanctificávit,} the Bishop resumes
the miter. The Deacon receives from the cleric the cruets containing the Chrism
and the Oil of the Catechumens which he hands to the Bishop. The latter takes
the cruets in his right hand (or one cruet in each hand) and pours the holy
oils conjointly on the middle of the altar in a straight line from the epistle
side to the gospel side. The Bishop gives the cruets to the Deacon, who hands
them to the server to return them to the credence. The Bishop draws back the
right sleeve of his cassock and alb\footnote{An elastic or rubber band may be
used to keep the bishop's sleeve back. The deacon, subdeacon and masters of
ceremonies must take great care to prevent the bishop's sleeves touching the
altar.} and with the palm of his right hand rubs spreads the holy oils over the
entire surface of the altar, first towards the back of the altar and then
towards the front of it. The Deacon and Subdeacon hold the borders of the
Bishop's cope.

\rubric After the unction the Bishop will wipe his hand and his ring first with
cotton and then with the towel, after which he will adjust the sleeves of his
cassock and his alb. The server carries the cruets back to the table. The
Bishop, facing the altar and standing on the predella, intones the antiphon
\textit{Ecce odor filii mei} (these four words only), which the chanters
continue and to which they add the psalm \textit{Fundamenta ejus}. The
\textit{Glória Patri} is not added and the antiphon is not repeated.

While the chanters are singing the platform is placed near the wall under the
cross painted on the wall etiher behind the altar or opposite the gospel corner
of the altar. A server prepares a thurible and a boat; a server prepares a
salver with chrism and cotton, and Chart 5.

\rubric After the psalm is completed, the Bishop with miter stands on the
predella facing the altar and recited the invitatory \textit{Lápidem hunc.} He
then intones the antiphon \textit{Lápides pretiósi} (these two words only),
whicht eh chaners contintue and to which they add the psalm \textit{Lauda
Jerúsalem} and the responsories \textit{H\ae c est Jerúsalem} and
\textit{Platé\ae\ tu\ae.} The antiphon is not repeated.

\section{Anointing of the Twelve Crosses on the Walls of the Church.}

\rubric Having intoned the antiphon \textit{Lápides pretiósi,} the Bishop
descends to the foot of the altar and takes the crosier in the left hand.
Preceeded by the thurifer, the server with the Chrism, and cross-bearer and
acolytes, the Bishop flanked by the ministers goes to the cross painted on the
wall under which the platform was placed. The cross-bearer and acolytes stand
at the left oft eh platform, the server wtih the Christ to the right of it.
Crosier away, the bishop ascends the platform with the deacon and subdeacon.
The deacon at the Bishop's right holds the Chrism\footnote{Or he may give it to
the bishop.} and the subdeacon is at the Bishop's left holding Chart
5.\footnote{If the platform is not large enough for the bishop and his
minsters, the master of ceremonies may go up with the bishop and perform the
duties of the deacon and subdeacon; but if he is not in sacred orders, he
cannot wipe away the oil that may flow on the wall.} The bishop dips his right
thumb into the Christ and anoints the wall on the painted
cross\footcite[\textit{Above} or \textit{below} the cross, if it be of marble
or metal. See][note 2, p. 112.]{stehle} in the manner described above, saying:

\begin{quote}
    Sancti\cross ficétur et conse\cross crétur hoc templum: In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti: in honórem Dei, et
    gloriós\ae\ Vírginis Marí\ae, atque ómnium Sanctórum: ad nomen, et memóriam
    Sancti N. (\textit{Sanctórum N.N.}). Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

He then wipes his thumb with cotton handed to him by the deacon. If the oil
flow down the wall, the Deacon wipes it away with cotton.

After the unction the Bishop descends and the platform is carried to the next
cross painted on the wall towards the left of the first cross, i.e., on the
gospel side, proceeding towards the front of the church. The bishop then facing
the cross on the wall which he just anointed puts incense into the censer, the
Deacon offering the boat, and blesses the incense in the cense, saying: 

\blessincense

The Deacon then removes the miter and hands the censer to the Bishop, who,
having bowed with his ministers to the cross, incenses it with three swings.

After the incensation all bow to the cross; the Bishop gives the thurible to
the Deacon who hands it to the thurifer; the Bishop resumes the miter and the
crosier, an all proceed to the second cross under which the platform was
placed.

\rubric This ceremony is carried out at each of the twelve crosses painted on
the wall, except that it is not necessary to put incense into the thurible at
every cross, but it will be sufficient to renew it when necessary, i.e., at
every third or fourth cross. The crosses are anointed in order, first on the
gospel side, then at the front of the church, i.e., on either side of the main
door, afterwards on the epistle side, beginning at the front of the church and
finishing at the cross opposite the epistle corner of the altar or behind the
altar.

\rubric While the last cross is being anointed one server gets ready the
grains of incense on a salver and another the aspergillum. After the last
unction the platform is removed. A server takes away the Chrism; the
cross-bearer and the acolytes go to the gospel side of tha altar and stand
\textit{in plano;} the thurifer carries the thurible to thes acristy; the
Bishop and his ministers go to the foot of the altar, where the Bishop gives
the crosier away and they ascend the predella and stand before the middle of
the altar.

\rubric The \textit{incensing} priest goes to the Bishop and presents the
thurible. The Bishop imposes incense in the usual manner, saying:

\blessincense

The bishop, facing the altar, intones the antiphon \textit{\AE dificávit
Móyses} (these two words only), which the chanters continue. After intoning,
the bishop receives the thurible from the \textit{incensing} priest, incenses
this time only the table of the atlar and then gives the thurible to the priest
who continues ine incensation as before.

\section{Burning of the Incense on the Altar.}

\rubric After the antiphon \textit{\AE dificávit Móyses} has been sung, the
Bishop, still wearing the miter, recites the invitatory \textit{Dei Patris
omnipoténtis.}

\rubric At the end of this invitatory a server carrying the crains of incense
on a salver and another server with the holy water ascend to the first step
below the predella; the Bishop turns towards these two servers and, miter
removed, blesses the grains of incense, saying the oration \textit{Dómine
Deus.} The Deacon hands the aspergil to the Bishop, who sprinkles the grains in
the middle, left and right. The aspersorium is handed back to the server, who
places it on the credence table.

The Bishop receives the miter from the DEacon and the salver containing the
grains of incense from the server. The latter goes to the epsitle corner
\textit{in plano,} where he will receive the salver from the deacon after all
the grains have been placed on the altar. A server brings to the altar the five
crosses made of wax tapers, and stands at the right of the deacon.

\rubric The Bishop, having turned to the altar, takes the grains of incense
from the salver and forms with five grains a cross at each of the five places
on the table of the altar where he before made the unctions with the Oil of
Catechumens and Holy Chrism, observing the order in the following
plan.\footnote{The center cross should not be placed over the sepulcher.}

\crossplan

After having made each cross, he places one of the crosses made of wax tapers
on the grains, before making the next cross.\footnote{Marginucci, Lib. VII,
cap. XVI, n. 112, foot-note, says that it is the custom (\textit{presumably in
Rome}) to attach beforehand five grains of incense to the crosses made of wax
tapers, and then the bishop needs only to place the taper-crosses at their
places with the grains of incense turned downwards. He remarks, ``\textit{H\ae
c ratio est commodior atque expeditior et pr\ae scriptio rubric\ae\ eodem modo
impletur.}''} As soon as the Bishop has made the fifth cross a server lights
the four ends of each cross of wax tapers.

The \textit{incensing} priest carries the censer to the sacristy and his duty
ceases. The salver is put on the credence.

\rubric A cushion is placed on the lowest step of the altar in the middle and,
when the crosses have been lit, the Bishop and his ministers descend to the
foot of the atlar. The Deacon removes the Bishop's miter and zucchetto, after
which all kneel. The Bishop, kneeling on the cushion, intones the
\textit{Alleluia} and the versicle \textit{Veni sancte Spíritus} (these words
only), which the chanters continue and to which they add the two antiphons
\textit{Ascéndit} and \textit{Stetis Angelus}.

\rubric The \textit{Alleluia} and the versicle \textit{Veni sancte
Spíritus\dots accende} having been sung, all rise and the Deacon puts the
zucchetto on the Bishop. When the chanters have finished the antiphon
\textit{Stetit Angelus} the Bishop says \textit{Orémus}, to which the Deacon
and Subdeacon add \textit{Flectámus génua; Leváte.} The Bishop recites the
prayer \textit{Dómine sancte.}

\rubric As soon as the grains of incense on the altar are consumed, servers
scrape with spatulas the burnt incense and wax from the atlar and place the
scrapings into a vessel prepared for that purpose. The scrapings are afterwards
thrown into the sacrarium. After the prayer \textit{Dóminus sancte} the Bishop
once again says \textit{Orémus}, to which the Deacon and Subdeacon add
\textit{Flectámus génua; Leváte.} The Bishop recites the prayer \textit{Deus
omnípotens.}

\rubric AFter this prayer, with his hands extended on his breast, the Bishop
recites in a \textit{moderate tone} of voice (or sings \textit{tono feriali}
the Preface. He says the conclusion in a low tone.

\section{Anointing of the Front of the Altar.}

\rubric The Bishop resumes the miter and ascends the predella with his
ministers. A server carries on a salver a vessel of Chrism and cotton, and
gives it to the Deacon. The Bishop intones the antiphon \textit{Confírma hoc
Deus} (these three words only), which the chanters continue and to which they
add the psalm \textit{Exsúrgat Deus.} The antiphon is not repeated.

\rubric As soon as the Bishop has intoned the antiphon \textit{Confírma hoc
Deus,} he dips his thumb into the Chrism and makes with it the sign of the
cross on the front of the altar, half-way between the altar and the predella,
saying nothing.\footnote{If a metal cross is affixed to the front of the altar,
it may be removed for this occasion, or the unction may be made \textit{above}
this cross.} If the front of the altar is not solid this unction is made on the
anterior part of the table, or if a column supports the table in front at the
center this unction is made on the front of the column's cap. When making this
unction the bishop does not kneel. If the holy oil should flow down the front
of the altar, the deacon wipes it off with cotton. After the unction, the
bishop wipes his thumb with cotton.

\rubric The servers receives the Chrism from the Deacon and carries it to the
posterior corner of the altar at the gospel side. The Bishop and his ministers
go to the foot of the altar and stand \textit{in plano} facing the altar.

After the psalm the Deacon removes the miter and the Bishop says the prayer
\textit{Majestátem.}

\section{Anointing of the Juncture of the Table and the Support.}

\rubric After this prayer the Bishop resumes his miter an goes with his
assistants to the posterior corner of teh altar at the gospel side and, having
dipped his thumb into the Chrism, makes with it three times the sign of the
cross over the junction of the table and support, as if to join them together,
drawing the upright line from the table to the support and the transverse line
over the juncture of the table and support, saying:

\begin{quote}
    In nómine Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti.
\end{quote}

He does the same in succession at the anterior corner on the gospel side, at
the posterior corner on the epistle side and lastly at the anterior corner on
the epistle side. If the holy oil should flow down the support, the deacon will
wipe it off with absorbent cotton.

\rubric The bishop returns with his ministers to the middle of the altar
\textit{in plano.} The server carries the Chrism to the table. The Bishop's
miter is removed and he says the prayer \textit{Súpplices.}

\rubric At the end of this prayer the bishop, with his ministers, goes to the
faldstool which is placed \textit{in plano} at the epistle corner of the altar
steps and sits. Two servers, one with the ewer and basin and the other carrying
a tray with cotton balls and alcohol swabs and a towel, go to the Bishop. The
Bishop cleans his hands, washes and dries them.

In the meantime two priests (deacons or subdeacons) rub off with cotton and
sponges the oil on the table of the altar and at its four corners and wipe
these places with coarse towels or cloths.

\section{Blessing of the Altar-cloths, Vases and Ornaments for the Consecrated Church and Altar.}

\rubric When the bishop has washed his hands and the altar has ben washed
servers bring to the faldstool the altar-cloths and other altar and church
ornaments to be blessed by the bishop.\footcite[In case they should be very
numerous, they may be left on a table to which the bishop goes and there
blesses them.][footnote 4, p. 128.]{consecranda} At the same time a server
takes the aspersorium and stands to the right of the Deacon. The Deacon removes
the miter and the bishop rises and blesses the altar cloths and other ornaments
with the prayer \textit{Omnípotens.}

After this the Deacon hands the aspergil to the Bishop who sprinkles the
articles. The Bishop then sits and resumes the miter.

\rubric The sacristans cover the atlar with the cerecloth\footnote{A linen
cloth, waxed on one side, which is commonly called the \textit{Chrismale.} It
must be of the exact size of the mensa, and it is placed under the linen
altar-cloths, the waxed side being turned towards the table.} over which they
place the three altar-cloths. The cross and candlesticks are also put in the
proper places, and the predella and steps of the altar are covered with
carpets.

When the clerics begin to cover the atlar the Bishop rises, and, having turned
towards the altar, intones the antiphon \textit{Circumdate Levit\ae} (these two
words only), which the chanters continue and to which they add the antiphons,
responsory and psalm that follow, during which the bishop, wearing the miter,
remains standing. The antiphon \textit{In velaménto,} which precedes the psalm,
is not repeated.

\section{Incensation of the Altar.}

\rubric When the altars have been covered and ornamented and the psalm
\textit{Deus Deus meus} is finished, the Bishop sits and in the usual manner
puts incense into the thurible held before him by the thurifer. The Bishop then
rises, receives the crosier and goes with his ministers to the foot of the
altar, where he lays aside the crosier and the Deacon removes the miter. The
Bishop bows to the cross on the altar, and the Deacon and Subdeacon make at the
same time a simple genuflection, after which they ascend to the predella. The
Deacon, having received the thurible from the thurifer, hands it to the Bishop,
who intones the antiphon \textit{Omnis terra} (these two words only), whihc the
chanters continue to the end. After the Bishop has intoned and antiphon, he
incenses the mensa by making \textit{once} with the thurible a cross over it.

When the chanters have finished the antiphon, the Bishop again intones the same
antiphon and incenses the mensa a second time in the same manner as above,
while the chanters repeat the antiphon.

At the end of the antiphon the Bishop intones the same antiphon a third time
and incenses the altar a third time in the same manner as above, while the
chanters repeat the antiphon.

Then the Bishop gives the thurible to the Deacon who hands it to the thurifer.

\rubric When the chanters have finished this antiphon the third time, the
Bishop, standing on the predella and facing the altar, recites the prayers
\textit{Descéndat} and \textit{Omnípotens} and the versicles which follow.

\rubric The Bishop with his ministers descends to the foot of the altar, where
he resumes his miter, bows to the cross ( the Deacon, Subdeacon and other
attendants make a \textit{simple} genuflection \textit{in plano}) and receives
the crosier.

Then the following is observed: either

\begin{enumerate}

    \item All repair to the sacristy, in the order in which they came to the
        Church, to vest for Mass; or

    \item If the Consecrator is to sing the Mass, he may be accompanied to the
        faldstool by the ministers; the latter then go to the sacristy to put
        on the dalmatic and tunic and return to the throne or faldstool to vest
        the consecrator; or

    \item If the Consecrator is to celebrate a \textit{low} Mass, he is led to
        the faldstool by the ministers, who remove the Consecrator's miter and
        cope. The ministers then, preceded by the cross-bearer, acolytes and
        other assisting servers, go to the sacristy and divest, and the
        chaplains take their places at the side of the Consecrator, whom they
        assist in vesting. If the Mass is celebrated by a priest, it ought to
        be a Solemn High Mass.
    
\end{enumerate}

While the celebrant and his ministers are vesting for Mass, the altars are
ornamented and the stoups at the entrance of the church are filled with holy
water. If any of teh holy water that was blessed \textit{at the door of the
church} remain, it may be used for this purpose.

After the Mass the ashes which were spread on the floor of the church for the
tracing of the Greek and Latin alphabets are swept away by the servants of the
church, the church undergoes a cleaning an the soiled sponges, towels, cloths,
absorbent cotton, etc., are removed.

\rubric This part of the ceremony takes place the evening before the
consecration. The candles on the table in the oratory are lit.

\rubric Assisting clergy with surplices, preceded by AC with holy-water, go to
the entrance of the oratory to receive B, vested in rochet and mantelletta,
with biretta. Bishop removes biretta at the entrace and receives holy water from the
rector.\footcite[The Bishop does not sprinkle the clergy, as the rubrics
prescribe, if he be not the Ordinary. See][note 1, p. 28.]{consecranda}

\rubric If there is an altar in the oratory, Bishop kneels on the lowest step before
it for a short time, then rises and goes to the table, dons a red stole, and
places\footnote{The bishop must observe the order of dignity: apostles,
martyrs, confessors, etc. as can be found in the Litany of the Saints.} the
relics into the reliquary with the three grains of incense and the attest of
the consecration.

\rubric After putting the lid on the reliquary, Bishop folds around it a red silk
ribbon that passes over the top, bottom and four sides of the reliquary and is
tied at the top. Sealing wax is dropped over the knot and is sealed with the
consecrator's signet.

\rubric Bishop carries the reliquary with both hands and places it in the urn, locks
the urn and removes his stole. Bishop kneels for a short time in prayer before the
reliquaries, rises and is accompanied by the clergy to the door, where he
departs.\footnote{The bishop may remain to recite the office with the clergy,
though the length of the ceremony of the next day may discourage the bishop
from doing so.}

\rubric Clergy return to the relics and recite Matins and Lauds \textit{De
communi plurimorum martyrum.} The lessons of the first nocturn are
\textit{Fratres, debitores,} etc.; of the second nocturn \textit{Quotiescumque,
fratres,} etc.; of the third nocturn \textit{Dominus ac redemptor.} The oration
is \textit{Deus, qui conspicis,} without mentioning the name of the martyrs,
found in the Breviary on October 14. No commemorations are made because it is a
votive office\footnote{The office \textit{Dedicationis Ecclesi\ae} cannot be
recited on this occasion --- S.R.C., Dec. 7, 1844, n. 2868. Neither does the
recitation of the office \textit{Sanctorum Martyrum} on this occasion dispense
from the recitation of the current office. The axiom \textit{``Officium pro
officio valet''} cannot here be applied. --- S.R.C., Sept. 16, 1881, n. 3532 ad
II.}.

\rubric During the night two candles should be kept burning before the
relics.\footnote{It is not necessary to repeat Matins and Lauds so that the
watch be kept throughout the night --- S.R.C., Feb. 22, 1888, n. 3686 ad III.}
Martinucci says that in Rome two, four or six lay persons continue the watch
until the relics are carried to the church on the following morning.

\section{Notes.}

\rubric The Consecrator may recite or sing the Orations\footnote{The rubrics
use the terms \textit{dicit, dicens}.}; if he sings them he used the
\textit{tonus ferialis.} The same rule applies for the Preface.

\rubric The antiphons, responsories, psalms\footnote{Except the seven
Penitential Psalms at the beginning of the function, which are recited
\textit{recto tono}.} and Litany ought to be sung\footnote{The rubrics say
\textit{cantat, cantant, schola seu ministris prosequentibus}.} unless
\textit{ob defunctum cantorum} it is impssible to do so, in which case they
should be recited \textit{recto tono.} 

\rubric The CB and ACs should stand opposite to the Consecrator, except when
they lead the procession and when the Consecrator is engaged at the altar, in
which case they stand \textit{in plano} on the Gospel side; they always
accompany the Consecrator when moving from one altar to another.

\rubric The miter and crosier bearers always stand or move behind the Consecrator.

\section{From the Beginning to the Blessing of the Water.}

\rubric The function ought to be begun at an early hour. All who are to take
part in the ceremony enter the sacristy or church. SD and D vest in amice, alb
and cincture, D dons a white stole. D (referred to as the ``Guard'') who is to
guard the church vests in the same manner as the officianting D.

\rubric The laity are not permitted into the church, and all doors but the main
doors are locked. D and SD flank the faldstool, which stands in the middle of
the church, facing the main doors. CB and ACs stand near D, facing the doors.
Assisting clergy in surplice and the Guard go to the entrance and receive B, in
the mantelletta, who is lead immediately to the faldstool. Bishop sits and orders
the twelve crosses to be lighted. The clergy arrange themselves in rows behind
and on the sides of the faldstool.

\rubric As soon as the candles have been lighted all go to the place where the
relics were kept overnight:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item CB and ACs;

    \item Chanters\footnote{If the chanters are not vested in cassock and
        surplice they precede the cross-bearer. See \cite{consecranda} Note 2,
        p. 31.} and clergy, two by two;

    \item Bishop between D and SD;

    \item B's attendants

\end{enumerate}

As soon as the procession has left the church the main doors are locked and
only the Gaurd is left in the church.

\rubric Upon arrival, CB and ACs stand to the Gospel side of the table, facing
the Epistle side; the clerics and priests stand in rows before the altar;
chanters go to the lectern. Bishop and minsters go to the altar and kneel before the
relics a short time in prayer; all kneel with them.

\rubric MC1 signals all to rise; Bishop goes to faldstool and sits down with
biretta, facing the door of the chapel, D and SD flanking. Once Bishop is seated MC2
distributes vestments to the clergy who will vest B; the clergy approach the
faldstool and stand a short distance from it. Book- and Candle-bearers take
Pontifical and candle and stand behind Bishop and to his left. Altar boys stand by
ready with ewer, basin and towel.

\rubric MC1 signals Bishop to remove biretta, rise and turn towards the relics; D
and SD switch sides. Bishop \textit{reads} in a loud tone \textit{Ne reminiscaris},
after which chanters and clergy slowly \textit{recite} the seven Pentitential
Psalms.

\rubric Bishop sits immediately after reading \textit{Ne reminiscaris.} D removes
B's pectoral cross and mantelletta. Bishop dons biretta and his hands are washed,
altar-boys standing.\footcite[See][note 1, p. 39.]{consecranda}

\rubric After the hand-washing, D takes biretta and the vesters approach B, who
stands. D and SD vest Bishop in amice, alb, cincture, pectoral cross, white stole
and cope. D imposes miter\footnote{It seems that Bishop should be sitting at this
time, since he does not normally receive the miter at the faldstool while
standing.} and Bishop receives crosier. Bishop sits with D and SD and they read
alternately\footcite[The bishop usually reads the first verse of each psalm and
recites the verse \textit{Gloria Patri.}][note 3, p. 39.]{consecranda} the
seven penitential psalms. Once the chanters have finished the seventh psalm B
alone repeats \textit{Ne reminiscaris.}

\rubric After the antiphon has been repeated all go to the main doors of the
church:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item CB and ACs;

    \item Chanters, two by two;\footnote{If the chanters are not vested in
        cassock and surplice they precede the cross-bearer.}

    \item Clergy two by two;

    \item Bishop between D and SD;

    \item Miter and crosier, book (with \textit{Pontificale}) and candle
        bearers.

\end{enumerate}

CB and ACs stand at the right side of the entrance so that Bishop can see the cross;
Chanters stand neaar the lectern; Clergy and clerics stand in semicircular
rows; Bishop stands with ministers in front of the door, facing it.

\rubric Crosier and miter away. Bishop intones \textit{Adesto Deus unus} (these
three words only) which the chanters continue to the end. Bishop afterwards says the
oration \textit{Actiones nostras}. After the oration Bishop receives miter and
kneels before the faldstool. All kneel at their places during the singing of
the litany, which the chanters begin once Bishop kneels. The litany is not doubled
and all present sing the responses. All rise after the response \textit{Exaudi
nos Domine} after the second \textit{Propitius esto}

\section{Blessing of the Water.}

\rubric Bishop receives the crosier and goes to the large table accompanied by
ministers, miter, crosier, book and candle bearers. Bishop stands in such a way that
he faces the cross, to which he bows as often as he says \textit{Oremus} or the
Holy Name.

\rubric Bishop exorcises\footnote{This exocism is particular to making Gregorian
Water.} the salt. Bishop then gives crosier away, D removes miter and blesses the
salt with his hands joined.

\rubric Bishop receives miter and crosier and exorcises the water.

\rubric Crosier away. D removes miter and Bishop blesses the water with joined
hands.

\rubric Bishop takes a handful of the blessed salt and drops it three times in the
form of a cross into the water saying \textit{Commíxtio salis et aqu\ae\
páriter fiat: In nómine Pa\cross tris et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\
sancti. \rbar Amen.}

\rubric D hands a towel to B; afterwards Bishop says with folded hands the oration
\textit{Deus, invíct\ae.}

\section{Blessing of the Exterior of the Church.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and returns with his ministers to the main entrance
where he stands facing the door. The server in charge of the holy water
transfers some of the Gregorian water into the aspersorium and then stands to
the right of D. D removes miter and hands aspergil to B, who intones
\textit{Asperges me}, which is continued by the chanters. Bishop sprinkles himself,
the clergy and the bystanders.

\rubric CB and ACs stand to the right of B, who resumes miter. CB and ACs
proceed Bishop and ministers around the outside of the church, epistle side first. B
sprinkles in the form of a cross the \textit{upper part of the walls} of the
church\footcite[The procession walks around and Bishop sprinkles the cemetery also
if it be adjacent.][n. 41, p. 44.]{consecranda} saying continually: \textit{In
nómine Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti,} not adding
the word \textit{Amen}. The holy water bearer walks to the right of D and the
people may follow B.\footcite[If it is impossible to go around the church, he
sprinkles the wall at his right as far as he can, then, passing by the front of
the church, he goes to the place at the other side of the church nearest the
point at which he stoped on the right side and begins to sprinkle the walls
from that point until he arrives at the main portal.][note 2, p.
44.]{consecranda}

\rubric The chanters finish the antiphon and sing the resonsory
\textit{Asperges me}, which is sung while Bishop sprinkles the outside of the
church.

\rubric Having arrived back at the main entrance, Bishop hands sprinkler to D, who
passes it to the water carrier.\footnote{The water carrier ought to refill at
this time.} D removes miter; CB and ACs stand at the right of B. When the
chanters have finished Bishop faces the door of the church says \textit{Orémus,} D
adds \textit{Flectámus génua,} and all make a simple
genuflection.\footnote{Except CB, ACs and book and candle bearers.}
Then\footnote{Subdeacon does not say \textit{Leváte} until everyone (or at
least the bishop and those close to him) achieved a genuflecting position.} SD
says \textit{Leváte} and all rise. Bishop says the oration \textit{Omnípotens
sempitérne Deus.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and receives the crosier, strikes the door
\textit{once} with the lower end of the crosier and says:

\begin{quote}
    Attóllite portas príncipes vestras, et elevámini port\ae\ \ae ternáles: et
    introíbit Rex glória\ae.
\end{quote}

The Guard from the inside of the church\footcite[The door may be slightly open,
so that the bishop and deacon can hear each other.][note 1, p.
46.]{consecranda} says in a loud tone:

\begin{quote}
   Quis est iste Rex Glóri\ae? 
\end{quote}

Bishop answers in the same tone:

\begin{quote}
    Dóminus fortis, et potens: Dóminus potens in pr\ae lio.
\end{quote}

\rubric Bishop gives away crosier, receives sprinkler from D and goes around the
church a second time, the same manner as before, but this time sprinkling the
\textit{lower part of the walls} of the church. As soon as Bishop begins this second
sprinkling chanters sing the responsory \textit{Benedic, Domine.}

\rubric Bishop returns to the main entrance and repeats the ceremonies performed
after his first circuit.

\rubric Bishop strikes the door as before and repeats the ceremonies as before.

\rubric For a third time, Bishop walks around the church, this time starting on the
\textit{left} side, sprinkling the wall at level of his face, chanters singing
the responsory \textit{Tu Domine.}

\rubric Bishop returns to the main entrance and repeats the ceremonies performed
after his first circuit.

\rubric Bishop strikes the door as before and repeats the ceremonies, this
time, after the Guard's interrogation, Bishop and all clergy answer:

\begin{quote}
    Dóminus virtútum ipse est Rex glóri\ae. Aperíte. Aperíte. Aperíte.
\end{quote}

\rubric Bishop makes with the lower part of the crosier the sign of the cross on the
threshold, saying \textit{Ecce cru\cross is signum, fugiant phantasmata
cuncta.} The door is then opened by the Guard. B, D and SD enter the church and
Bishop says in a loud tone \textit{Pax huic domui,} to which the Guard answers
\textit{In introitu vestro,} and all the clergy answer \textit{Amen.}

\rubric The Guard goes to the sacristy and devests. Bishop moves to the right so
that CB and ACs, chanters, assistant clerics and mason enter the church, after
which the church is closed and locked.\footnote{The visiting clergy and the
people remain outside the church.} All in the church most in procession, CB and
ACs in the lead, Bishop and ministers in the rear, followed by the book, candle,
miter and crosier bearers, to the faldstool which stands in the middle of the
church. During the procession the chanters sing the antiphons \textit{Pax \ae
terna} and \textit{Zach\ae\ efestinans.}

\section{Blessing of the Interior of the Church.}

\rubric CB and ACs stand at the epistle side of the faldstool, chanters stand
at the lectern, Bishop with ministers stands before the faldstool, facing the high
altar, and all the others stand near B. Upon the completion of the antiphons, B
gives crosier to crosier-bearer and D removes miter and zucchetto. MC1 signals
all to kneel on both knees and Bishop intones the \textit{Veni Creator Spiritus},
which is continued by the chanters. All rise at the end of the first strophe, D
replaces B's zucchetto, and remain standing until the end of the hymn.

\rubric At the beginning of the second strophe several assistants sprinkle the
floor the ashes in which the letters of the Latin and Greek alphabets are to be
delineated.\footnote{They may be sprinkles either in two lines going diagonally
though the church, or in forty-eight distinct squares. It will facilitate the
action of the bishop if the letters are formed beforehand with chalk on the
floor.}

\rubric After the singing of the \textit{Veni Creator Spiritus,} Bishop resumes
miter and kneels before the faldstool. All also kneel\footnote{Except for, of
course, the cross-bearer and acolytes, and the assistants sprinkling the ash.}
The chanters begin the litany, doubling the name (names) of the saint (saints)
in whose honor the church and the altar (altars) is consecrated and the names
of the martyrs whose relics are to be placed in the altar.\footcite[If the name
of any of these saints is inscried in the litany, e.g., St. Peter, St. Stephen,
it is invoked a second time immediately after the proper invocation in the
Litany. If the name is not in the Litany, it is inserted after the
\textit{individual} invocations of the saints of the same category, but before
the general invocation, e.g., if the church is consecrated in honor of St.
Francis de Sales, his name is inserted twice after \textit{Sancte Nicol\ae} and
before \textit{Omnes sancti Pontifices et Confessores.} If the church or altar
is consecrated in honor of the Blessed Virgin under any title whatever the
invocation \textit{Sancta Maria} is mentioned twice; if in honor of a mystery
of the Life and Passion of Our Lord, the petition \textit{Fili Redemptor mundi
Deus} is repeated.][Note, p. 51.]{consecranda}

\rubric The MC2 gets the Chart 1. After the chanters have sung \textit{Ut
omnibus fidelibus defunctis,} etc., and those present have answered \textit{Te
rogamus audi nos} B, D, SD and crosier-bearer rise. Bishop receives crosier and
recites, using Chart 1, held by the subdeacon, alternately with all present:

\begin{quote}
    \vbar Ut locum istum visitáre dignéris.\\
    \rbar Te rogámus audi nos.\\
    \vbar Ut in eo Angelórum custódiam deputáre dignéris.\\
    \rbar Te rogámus audi nos.\\
\end{quote}

Bishop then raises his right hand and blesses the altar (altars) and church
conjointly by making the sign of the cross towards the atlar as often as
indicated in the invocations that follow. D raises the border of B's cope
whenever Bishop makes the sign of the cross. After the petitions, Bishop gives away cross
and he and all who rose with him kneel and the Litany is sung to the last
\textit{Kyrie eleison.}

\rubric Ater the Litany, all rise; D removes miter. \textit{Oremus. Flectámus
génua. Leváte.} Bishop facing the altar says the two orations \textit{Pr\ae véniat
nos} and \textit{Magnificáre.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and receives the crosier. CB and ACs lead Bishop and
ministers to the corner at the gospel side of the main entrance. With the lower
extremity of the crosier, which is held in both hands, Bishop delineates the letters
of the Greek alphabet in the ashes spread on the floor from this corner to the
epistle corner of the church near the altar. Then he goes to the corner at the
epistle side of the main entrance and delineates in the same manner the letters
of the Latin alphabet in the ashes spread on the floor from this corner to the
gospel corner of the church near the altar.

CB and ACs stand opposite Bishop and move with him along the line. As soon as B
begins the Greek alphabet the chanters sing the \textit{Canticle of Zachary,}
the verses alternating with antiphons. The chanters take care that the antiphon
after the \textit{Sicut erat} will be sung when the bishop is writing the last
letters of the Latin alphabet. When the cantor notices that Bishop is approaching
the last letters of the Latin alphabet, he instructs the chanters to break off
singing the canticle and to begin the \textit{Gloria Patri.}\footcite[][p.
56.]{consecranda}

\rubric When Bishop has finished writing the Latin alphabet he goes with his
assistants, preceded by CB and ACs, to the altar which is to be consecrated,
and, standing a few paces from it, lays aside the crosier and miter. He then
kneels, all others kneeling with him, facing the altar, and says:

\begin{quote}
    \vbar Deus in adjutórium meum inténde.
\end{quote}

Bishop and all the others rise and the chanters say:

\begin{quote}
    \rbar Dómine ad adjuvándum me festína.
\end{quote}

Bishop standing in the same place and without miter says:

\begin{quote}
    \vbar Glória Patri, et Fílio, et Spirítui sancto.
\end{quote}

To which the chanters answer:

\begin{quote}
    \rbar Sicut erat in princípio, et nunc, et semper, et in s\'\ae cula s\ae
    culórum. Amen.
\end{quote}

This ceremony is performed three times, commencing in a higher tone each time,
the chanters answering each time in the same tone as B. All present kneel and
rise with B. 

\section{Blessing of the Gregorian Water.}

\rubric After the \textit{Sicut erat} has been recited the third time Bishop resumes the
miter and receives the crosier, and goes with assistants, preceded by CB and
ACs, to the table on which the water, ashes, salt and wine are kept. CB and ACs
stand on the opposite side of the table as B, facing him. Bishop retains miter and
crosier and exorcises the salt. Bishop then lays aide the crosier, miter is removed
and he blesses the salt.

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and crosier and exorcises the water; then he lays aside
the crosier and miter and blesses the water. 

\rubric Without miter or crosier, Bishop blesses the ashes.

\rubric With his right hand he takes a handful of the salt and drops it on the
ashes three times in the form of a cross, saying:

\begin{quote}
   Commíxtio salis et cíneris páriter fiat. In nómine Pa\cross tris, et
    Fí\cross lii et Spíritus\cross sancti. \\
   \rbar Amen.
\end{quote}

Bishop mixes the salt and ashes with his right hand. Bishop then takes a handful of this
mixture and drops it into the water \textit{one} time\footcite[The Pontifical
seems to indicate that the bishop performs this ceremony \textit{three times,}
but the authors imply that it is done only \textit{once.}][footnote 1, p.
60.]{consecranda} in the form of a cross saying:

\begin{quote}
    Commíxtio salis, cíneris, et aqu\ae\ páriter fiat. In nómine Pa\cross tris,
    et Fí\cross lii et Spíritus\cross sancti. \\
   \rbar Amen.
\end{quote}

D hands Bishop a towel with which he wipes his hand.

\rubric Bishop then without miter or crosier, blesses the wine. He then takes the
cruet of wine in his right hand and pours the wine intot he water three times
in the form of a cross saying:

\begin{quote}
    Commíxtio vini, salis, cíneris, et aqu\ae\ páriter fiat. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii et Spíritus\cross sancti. \\
   \rbar Amen.
\end{quote}

Bishop then recites the oration that follows.

\rubric Bishop resumes the miter and says the prayer \textit{Santcti\cross ficáre}
over the water.

\rubric Bishop receives crosier and goes the the main door of the church accompanied
by D and SD and predeced by CB and ACs. With the lower extremity of the
crosier, Bishop makes a cross on the inner side of the dorr on the upper part and
another cross on the lower part. He then gives away the crosier and, retaining
the miter and facing the door, he says the prayer \textit{Sit pósitis crux.}

\rubric Bishop receives crosier and returns to the table on which the water was
blessed. Bishop gives the crosier to the crosier-bearer and with the miter, facing
the altar, says the invitatory \textit{Deum Patrem omnipoténtem.}

While Bishop recites this invitatory a cleric fills the aspersorium with the
Gregorian water and goes to the epistle corner of the altar to be consecrated.
He takes a towel with him as well. MC2 takes Chart 2 to the gospel corner of
the altar.

}

\chap{Consecration of the Altar}{

\section{Sprinkling of the Altar.}

\rubric Bishop takes crosier and goes to the altar which is to be consecrated. At
the foot of the altar he gives away his crosier and ascends the predella where
he intones the antiphon \textit{Introibo ad altare Dei}(these four words only),
which is continued by the chanters. After the antiphon the chanters sing the
psalm \textit{Judica me Deus,} and \textit{if necessary} they repeat the
antiphon \textit{Introibo} after each verse of this psalm.\footcite[The rubric
after the first verse of this psalm says that the antiphon should be repeated
after each verse \textit{si necesse fuerit.} The necessity would arise if
\textit{several} altars were bering consecrated at the same time for the object
of the repetition seems to be that the chant should continue as long as the
function. If only \textit{one} altar is consecrated, the antiphon is repeated
only at the end of the psalm instead of the \textit{Gloria Patri,} etc.,
\textit{which is omitted.} The same is the case with the psalms that
follow.][footnote 1, p. 64.]{consecranda} The \textit{Gloria Patri} is omitted
and the antiphon \textit{Introibo} is repeated in its place.

\rubric After intoning \textit{Introibo} Bishop dips the thumb of his right hand
into the Gregorian water and makes with it the sign of the cross on the table
of the altar in the middle when he pronounces the word \textit{Sanctificetur},
and then raising his right hand he makes the sign of the cross over the pace
which he signed with his thumb three times at the end:

\begin{quote}
    Sancti\cross ficétur hoc altáre, in honórem Dei omnipoténtis, et
    gloriós\ae\ Vírginis Marí\ae, atque ómnium Sanctórum, et ad nomen ac
    memóriam Sancti N. (\textit{Santórum N. N.}). In nómine Pa\cross tris, et
    Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti. Pax tibi. 
\end{quote}

\rubric D receives the aspersorium from the cleric and holds it before B, and
SD holds before Bishop Chart 2 which contains the above formula. Having performed
this rite  on the cneter of the mensa, Bishop repeats it with the same ceremonies
and the same formula successively at the posterior corner of the gospel side,
the anterior corner of the epistle side, the anterior corner of the gospel side
and the posterior corner of the epistle side.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l c r | }
       \hline
       \cross\ \textbf{2} &                    & \textbf{5} \cross\ \\
                          & \cross\ \textbf{1} &                    \\
       \cross\ \textbf{4} &                    & \textbf{3} \cross\ \\
       \hline
   \end{tabular} 
\end{center}

D receives the towel from the cleric and hand it to the bishop who dries his
thumb with it, after which Bishop hands towel back to D who hadns it and the
aspersorium to the cleric. MC2 receives Chart 2 from SD.

\rubric Bishop goes to the middle of the altar and remians standing on the predella.
When the chanters have repeated the antiphons after the psalm, miter removed.
\textit{Oremus; Flectámus genua; Leváte.} Afterwards Bishop says the prayer
\textit{Singuláre.}

During this prayer the cleric carries thte towel to the table and refills the
aspersorium with the Gregorian water and returns to the right of D. MC2 carries
Cart 2 to the mensa.

\rubric Bishop intons the antiphon \textit{Asperges me} (these two words only) which
the chanters continue to the end, after which they sing the first three verses
of the psalm \textit{Miserere.} After intoning, Bishop resumes miter, receives the
aspergil from D and sprinkles the support and mensa conjointly. Bishop begins in
front at the middle of the altar, proceeds to the epistle side, passes behind
the altar and returns by the gospel side to the iddle at the front of the
altar. Bishop is accompanied by D, SD and AC with aspersorium.\footcite[If the back
part of the altar is attached to the wall, so that the bishop cannot go around
it, he sprinkles only the \textit{base} of the base of the altar when passing
from the middle to the epistle corner, then the epistle side of the altar,
afterwards the table of the altar from the epistle corner to the gospel corner,
then the gospel side of the altar and finaly the \textit{base} in front of the
altar from the gospel corner to the middle.][footnote, p. 68.]{consecranda}

\textsc{Note. ---} If the support at any part of the atlar consists only of
columns, then only the columns are sprinkled.\footcite[][p. 68.]{consecranda}

\rubric Having arrived at the center of the altar, Bishop waits until the chanters
have sung the third verse of the \textit{Miserere,} after which he intones a
second time the antiphon \textit{Asperges me} and sprinkles the altar as
before, while the chanters sing the antiphon and the next three verses of the
\textit{Miserere.}

\rubric The altar is sprinkled seven times in this manner. Before each
sprinkling Bishop intones the \textit{Asperges me,} which the chanters continue,
after which they sing three verses of the psalm \textit{Miserere,} except at
the seventh sprinkling, when only two verses are sung.

\section{Sprinkling of the Walls and Floor.}

\rubric At the middle of the altar, after the seventh sprinkling, Bishop descends
from the predella to the foot of the altar. Proceeded by CB and ACs,
accompanied by D, SD and AC with aspersorium, Bishop goes behind the altar. Once
chanters begin the \textit{H\ae c est domus} Bishop begins to sprinkle the lower
part of the wall, commencing at the middle behind the altar and then, preceded
by the CB and ACs, he passes donw the \textit{gospel} side and returns by the
\textit{epistle} side and finishes at the point behind the altar where he
began. Chanters meanwhile sing \textit{H\ae c est domus} and the psalm
\textit{L\ae tátus sum}; no \textit{Glória Patri} and the antiphon is not
repeated.

\rubric As soon as the chanters have finished \textit{L\ae tatus sum} they
begin to sing the antiphon \textit{Exsurgat Deus} and the psalm \textit{In
ecclesiis,} Bishop goes around the inside of the church a second time in the manner
described above and sprinkles the midle part\footnote{\textit{circa altitudinem
faciei su\ae}} of the wall. No \textit{Glória Patri} after the psalm and the
antiphon is not repeated.

\rubric As soon as the chanters have finished \textit{In ecclesiis} they sing
the antiphon \textit{Qui habitat} and the psalm \textit{Dict Domino,} Bishop goes
around the inside of the church beginning in the middle behind the altar,
passes this time down the \textit{epistle} side and returns by the
\textit{gospel} side, and finishes at the point behind the altar where he
began. He sprinkles the upper part of the wall. No \textit{Glória Patri} after
the psalm and the antiphon is not repeated.

\rubric Bishop returns to the foot of the altar. When chanters intone the antiphon
\textit{Domus mea} B, preceded by CB and ACs and accompanied by D, SD and
server with the Gregorian water, goes from the altar to the mian door of the
church sprinkling the floor; then he goes to the middle fo thewall at the
gospel side and passes in a direct line to the middle of the wall on the
epistle side likewise sprinkling the floor; after which Bishop goes the the center
of the church.

\rubric Having reached the center of the church Bishop stands facing the altar and
when the chanters have finished the antiphon \textit{Non est hic,} Bishop intones
the antiphon \textit{Vidit Jacob scalam} (these three words only), which the
chanters sing to the end. Having intoned this antiphon he sprinkles the floor
towards the East, the West, the North and the South.\footcite[The Rubric in the
\textit{Pontificale Romanum} supposes the altar to be towards the East; the
bishop, therefore, sprinkles the floor before him, behind him, at his left and
than at his right.][footnote 1, p. 74.]{consecranda}

\rubric After the atniphon the miter is removed; Bishop turns towards the door of
the church. \textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua; Leváte.} Bishop says the prayer
\textit{Deus, qui loca.}

\rubric Bishop still facing the door: \textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua; Leváte.} B
says the prayer \textit{Deus sanctificatiónum}, inserting the name of the saint
(saints) whose name the church will bear is inserted.

\rubric B, facing the door, recites with hands extended at his breast the
Preface, in which after N. he inserts the name of the saint (saints) whose name
the church will bear.

\textsc{Note. ---} During the Preface the priests, who will carry the holy
relics to the church, go to the place where the relics are exposed and put on
amice, alb, cincture and red chasuble. Torches are prepared for the procession
and the thurifer prepares the thurible.

Bishop adds the conclusion in a low tone of voice, loud enough to be head by those
near him.

\rubric After the Preface Bishop resumes miter and, accompanied by his assistants,
goes to the foot of the altar to bless the \textit{dry} cement\footcite[The
Pontifical prescrives that he should first mix the cement with the water which
he previously blessed and then bless the mixture. This is not feasible and
consequently it is better to keep sufficient amount of water in a separate
vessel to be poured over the dry cement shortly before it is to be used for
closing the sepulchre.][footnote, p. 77.]{consecranda} contained in a dish,
which a server holds before B. Miter removed, Bishop reads the oration \textit{Summe
Deus.}

After this the Gregorian water, except that which is reserved for preparing the
cement, is poured around the base of the altar.\footcite[If much water remains
only a small quantity of it is poured around the base of the altar, and what is
left is afterwards poured into the \textit{secrarium.}][footnote 1, p.
78.]{consecranda}

\section{Bringing of the Holy Relics to the Church.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and crosier and all go in procession to the place where
the relics are exposed, in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item CB and ACs;
    \item Chanters\footnote{If the chanters are not vested in cassock and
        suplice they precede the cross-bearer.}
    \item Clergy, two by two;
    \item Server carrying the vase of Chrism and some absorbent cotton on a
        salver;\footnote{Cotton sheets (woven and unwoven) are superior to
        cotton balls in this case.}
    \item B, between D and SD;
    \item Miter, crosier, book an candle-bearers.
\end{enumerate}

The procession passes through the main entrace of the church. The server
carrying the Chrism remains at the door. A server lights the candles on the
table outside the main entrance and on the table inside the church on which the
relics are to be placed. All others go to the oratory where the relics are
exposed.

\rubric All reamins standing outside the oratory. Bishop gives crosier to the
crosier-bearer and his miter is removed. \textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua;
Leváte.} Bishop recites \textit{Aufer a nobis.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter and crosier. The procession moves into the oratory,
while the chanters sing several antiphons and the psalm \textit{Venite
exultemus;} the \textit{Glória Patri} is not sung. Instead of the prescribed
antiphons and the psalm \textit{Venite exultemus,} a Respontory proper of the
martyrs whose relics are exposed, or one taken from the \textit{Commune
Plurimorum SS. Martyrum} may be sung.

\rubric After the psalm of responsory B's miter is removed. \textit{Orémus;
Flectámus génua; Leváte.} Bishop recites the prayer \textit{Fac nos, qu\ae sumus.}

\rubric Bishop resumes miter, imposes incense with the usual ceremonies.
Meanwhile lighted torches are distributed among the clergy. Bishop intones the
antiphon \textit{Cum jucunditate} (these two words only) and the chanters
continue this antiphon and sing the three others that follow, while the relics
are carried in procession to the church in the following order:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item CB and ACs;
    \item Chanters;
    \item Priests carrying lighted torches;
    \item TH swinging the censer before the relics;
    \item Two or Four Priests vested in red chasubles carrying the relics on a
        bier;\footcite[Instead of these priets the consecrator may carry the
        relics on s salver.][footnote 1, p. 81.]{consecranda}
    \item Bishop with miter and crosier between D and SD;
    \item Miter, Crosier, Book and Candle bearers;
    \item Laity.
\end{enumerate}

When the procession arrives at the door of the church the chanters remain there
and continue the chanting of the antiphons, whilst all the others, in the order
above, go around the outside of the church beginning at the right (epistle)
side, passing around the rear, and returning to the door by the left (gospel)
side, saying continually \textit{Kyrie eléison\dots}

\rubric When the procession returns to the front of the church the cros-bearer
and the acolytse take their places at the left side of the door and the relics
are placed on the table prepared for them. The priests who carried the relics
in the procession, the thurifer and the clergy carrying torches, arrange
themselves around this table in such a manner that the relics may be seen by
the bihsop when sitting on the faldstool placed at the right side of the door.
When the bishop arrives at the door he gives his crosier to the crosier-bearer
and sits on the faldstool, after which he may give an exhortation to the
people.\footcite[The exhortation here spoken of, the decrees of the Council of
Trent which according to the Pontifical are now read by the archdeacon (any
priest), the address of the Bishop to the founder of the church and the
latter's reply may be omitted. --- S.R.C., May 17, 1890, n. 3729 ad
VIII.][footnote 2, p. 82.]{consecranda}

\rubric The bishop remains sitting while the chanters sing the responsory
\textit{Erit mihi.}

\rubric When this responsory is finished the miter is removed and the bishop
rises and turns towards the door. \textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua; Leváte.} B
reads the prayer \textit{Domum tuam.}

\rubric The bishop resumes miter. Deacon and Subdeacon holding the border of
his cope, the Bishop goes to the right side of the door. He dips his thumb into
the Chrism and anoints three times the sotne pillar at the place where the
cross is scuptured,\footcite[The Pontifical says ''\textit{signat ostium,''}
which the S.R.C., Aug. 7, 1875, n. 3364 ad VI, interprets to mean the two stone
or brick pillars at the sides of the door.][footnote 1, p. 83.]{consecranda}
saying:

\begin{quote}
   In nomine Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spirítus \cross Sancti.
\end{quote}

He then goes to the left side of the door and in the same manner anoints three
times with Chrism the stone pillar at the place where the cross is sculptured.
After wiping his thumb in cotton he goes to the middle of the door says the
prayer \textit{Porta sis.}

\rubric The Bishop goes to the faldstool and standing intones the antiphon
\textit{Ingredimini sancti Dei} (these three words only) which the chanters
continue to the end and then add the second antiphon \textit{Gaudent in c\oe
lis.} After his intonation, the Bishop receives his crosier and all enter the
church in the order given above and proceed to the altar which is to be
consecrated. The people are now allowed to enter the church. Cross-bearer and
Acolytes stand at the gospel side, and the chanters at the lectern on the
gospel side, and the clergy carrying torches in a semicircle around the altar.
The priests who carry the relics place the bier on the table prepared for them
and remain standing near the table. The Bishop and his assitants stand before
the altar in the middle of the sanctuary.

\rubric The Bishop lays aside his crosier and intones the antiphon
\textit{Exultabunt sancti} (these two words only) which the chantesr contineu,
and to which they add the psalms \textit{Cantate Domino} and \textit{Laudate
Dominum.} The \textit{Gloria Patri} is not said and the antiphon is repated
after the second psalm. Meanwhile a server places on the altar near the center
on the epistle side the small stock containing the Chrism and the slab of stone
which is to be placed over the sepulchre after the case containing the relics
has been placed in it, and MC2 places Chart 3 (formula of consecration) on the
gospel side.

\section{Placing of the Holy Relics in the Sepulchre.}

\rubric While the antiphon \textit{Exsultabunt} is being repeated, the Bishop
and his assitants ascend to the predella, where the Deacon removes the miter.
After the antiphon the Bishop facing the altar says the prayer \textit{Deus,
qui in omni loco.}

\rubric The Bishp resumes his miter and anoints each of the four corners of the
sepulchre on the inside, reciting while anointing each corner:

\begin{quote}
    Conse\cross crétur et sancti\cross ficétur hoc sepúlcrum. In nómine
    Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti. Pax huic dómui.
\end{quote}

\textsc{Note. ---} The Bishop anoints each corner \textit{twice,} i.e., once at
the word \textit{Consecretur} and again at the word \textit{Sanctificetur.} He
then reaises his right hand and makes the sign of the cross three times over
the corner just anointed, i.e., at the wrods \textit{Patris, Filii} and
\textit{Spiritus sancti.}

\rubric Afterwards the Bishop wipes his thumb with cotton, his miter is removed
and he turns towards the people, receding a little to the gospel side but
remaining on the predella. The Priests who carried the relics in the procession
carry the bier and urn containing the relics to the Bishop. The Deacon opens
the urn and the Bishop takes out with both hands the case containing the
relics, and turning towards the altar, places the case into the sepulchre while
intoning the antiphon \textit{Sub altare Dei} (these three words only) which
the chanters continue to the end.

The bier and urn are carried back to the table by the four priests mentioned
above. The candles on this table are extinguished and the four priests go to
the sacristy and divest.

In the meantime the mason mixes in a dish the blessed cement with the Gregorian
water set aside for this purpose.

\rubric During the antiphon \textit{Sub altare Dei} the Bishp imposes incense
and incenses the relics with three swings, bowing profoundly before and
afterwards. The Bishop resumes his miter, takes in his left hand the small slab
that is to cover the sepulchre, dips his right thumb into the Chrism and
anoints bottom of the slab in the same manner as he anointed the crosses,
saying:

\begin{quote}
    Conse\cross crétur et sancti\cross ficétur h\ae c tábula, per istam
    untiónem et Dei benedictiónem. In nómine Pa\cross tris, et Fí\cross lii, et
    Spíritus \cross\ sancti. Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

\rubric The Bishop then places the slap on the altar (not over the sepulchre)
and wipes his thumb with cotton. The dish containing the prepared cement is now
brought to the altar and with a small trowel the Bishop spreadst the cement
over the ledge on the inside of the sepulchre.\footcite[The bishop may be
assisted by the mason, and care should be taken that the cement does not fall
on the sack containing the relics.][footnote 1, p. 89.]{consecranda} The Bishop
now takes the slab in his hand, intones the antiphon \textit{Sub altare Dei}
and places the slab over the opening of the sepulchre. The chanters continue
the antiphon \textit{Sub altare Dei audivi,} to which they add, if necessary,
the antiphon \textit{Corpora sanctorum.}

\rubric As soon as the chanters have finished the antiphons the Bishop removes
his miter and says the oration \textit{Deus, qui ex ómnium.} Miter resumed, the
Bishop \textit{begins} to fill with cement the crevices around the small slab,
which the mason may continue and finish. If any cement remain on the altar, it
is removed with a sponge or rough trowel.\footnote{A damp sponge is better for
this, as both a dry sponge and a rough trowel will tend to scratch the surface
of the altar.} The torches carried by the clergy are extinguished. The Bishop
dips his thumb in the Chrism and anoints once the top of the slab and the
altar\footcite[Martinucci, Hartmann, etc., say that the cross should be made
not only on the slab, but also on the portions of the table of the altar near
the slab as indicated by the cut.][footnote 1, p. 90.]{consecranda} in the
manner in which he anointed the four corners of the sepulchre, saying:

\begin{quote}
    Signé\cross tur et sancti\cross ficétur hoc altáre. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti. Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

The Bishop then wipes his thumb with cotton. The Deacon gives the Chrism to the
server and the Subdeacon gives Chart 3 to MC2.

The Chrism is carried to the credence. The cotton used by the Bishop and the
sponge or towel used in removing the cement from the altar, as well as the
scrapings of the cement, are thrown into the vessel prepared for this purpose
behind the altar.

\section{Incensation of the Altar.}

\rubric Incense is imposed at the altar in the usual manner, the Bishop saying:

\begin{quote}
   Ab illo benedicáris, in cujus honóre cremáberis. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti. \rbar Amen.
\end{quote}

The Miter is removed. The Deacon hands the thurible to the Bishop, who intones
the antiphon \textit{Stetit Angelus} (these two words only). The miter is
resumed and the Bihsop incenses the altar to the right, to the left, in front
and over the table until the chanters have finished the antiphon.

\rubric The Bishop give the thurible to the Deacon, and, miter removed,
standing on the predella in the middle of the altar, says the prayer
\textit{Dirigátur orátio nostra.} The Bishop resumes the miter and goes with
his attendants to the faldstool, placed \textit{in plano} at the epistle corner
of the steps of the altar, and sits.

\rubric Two priests, deacons or subdeacons, bested in suplice, wipe with
sponges the altar and its base, and then dry these places with rough towels.
The sponges and towels are afterwards placed in a large vase behind the altar.
After the function they are washed and the water of this washing is poured into
the sacrarium.

A server carrying Chart 4 containg the formula used at the following unctions
will stand \textit{in plano} at the gospel side, and another cleric carrying a
salver with the Oil of Catechumens and some cotton will stand \textit{in plano}
at the epistle side. The priest\footnote{From now on, referred to as the
\textit{incensing priest.}}, vested in surplice, whose duty it will be to
incense the altar during the consecration will stand near the server with the
holy oil.

\rubric When the altar has been wiped and dried, the Bishop, still sitting,
imposes and blesses incense in the usual manner. He then rises, ascends the
predella, receives the thurible from the Deacon and, saying nothing, incenses
in the form of a cross the table of the altar \textit{once}: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item in the middle,
    \item at the posterior corner of the gospel side,
    \item at the anterior corner of the epistle side,
    \item at the anterior corner of the gospel side,
    \item at the posterior corner of the epistle side.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l c r | }
       \hline
       \cross\ \textbf{2} &                    & \textbf{5} \cross\ \\
                          & \cross\ \textbf{1} &                    \\
       \cross\ \textbf{4} &                    & \textbf{3} \cross\ \\
       \hline
   \end{tabular} 
\end{center}

\rubric The Deacon takes the thurible from the Bishop and hands it to the
thurifer. The Bishop imposes incense in the usual manner. The Bishop again
receive the thurible from the Deacon and intones the responsory
\textit{Dirigatur} (this word only), which the chanters continue to the end.
During the chant of this responsory the Bishop goes around the altar
\textit{three times} incensing continuously the support and the table together.
He begins each time at the middle, proceeds to the epistle corner, then behind
the altar, and, passing by the gospel corner, returns to the middle in
front.\footcite[If the back of the altar is attached to the wall, he begins at
the middle, incenses the support as fas as the epistle corner, afterwards the
table from the epistle to the gospel side, then the side of the altar at the
gospel side, then the side of the altar at the gospel corner and finally the
support from the gospel corner to the middle.][footnote 1, p. 96.]{consecranda}

\rubric After the third incensation, the Incensing Priest will go the the
predella, receive the thurible from the Bishop with the usual kisses, descend
\textit{in planum} at the middle and when the Bishop has intoned the antiphon
\textit{Erexit Jacob} he will begin to incense the altar with \textit{single}
swings. He begins at the middle, proceeds to the epistle corner, goes behind
the altar and returns to the front of the altar by the gospel side, walking
always \textit{in plano.} This he does continuously, except when the Bishop
uses the thurible in the course of the consecration.

\section{Anointing of the Altar.}

\rubric The Bishop, having given the thurible to the Incensing Priest, intones
the antiphon \textit{Erexit Jacob} (these two words only) which the chanters
continue and to which they add the psalm \textit{Quam dilecta.}\footcite[The
rubric appplied to psalm 42 above applied here as well.]{consecranda} The
\textit{Gloria Patri} is not added. The antiphon is repeated after the psalm.

\rubric While the bishop is intoning the antiphon \textit{Erexit Jacob} the
server at the gospel side gives Chart 4 to the Subdeacon who holds it before
the Bishop, and the server at the epistle side give the \textit{Oleum
Catechumenorum} to the Deacon. A server holding a slaver with cotton balls
stands at the right of the deacon. After intoning the antiphon the Bishop
anoints with the \textit{Oleum Catechumenorum} the table of the altar in the
form of a cross in the middle and at the four corners in the following order:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l c r | }
       \hline
       \cross\ \textbf{2} &                    & \textbf{5} \cross\ \\
                          & \cross\ \textbf{1} &                    \\
       \cross\ \textbf{4} &                    & \textbf{3} \cross\ \\
       \hline
   \end{tabular} 
\end{center}

pronouncing the following form at \textit{each} unction:

\begin{quote}
    Sancti\cross ficétur et conse\cross crétur lapis iste. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti: in honórem Dei, et
    gloriós\ae\ Vírginis Marí\ae, atque ómnium Sanctórum: ad nomen, et memóriam
    Sancti N. (\textit{Sanctórum N.N.}). Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

At each unction the Bishop makes the sign of the cross with his thumb twice,
i.e., at the words \textit{Sanctificetur} and \textit{Consecretur,} then
raising his right hand he blesses it three times, i.e., at the words
\textit{Patris, Filii} and \textit{Spiritus sancti.} At the letter \textit{N.}
in the formula he inserts the name (\textit{names}) of the saint
(\textit{saints}) to whom the altar is dedicated. During this ceremony the
Deacon and Subdeacon hold the borders of the Bishop's cope. After the last
unction the bishop wipes his thumb with cotton, and the Deacon and Subdeacon
give the \textit{Oleum Catechumenorum} and Chart 4 to the servers.

\textsc{Note. ---} Another thurible may be prepared for the incensation, which
is to follow, and given to the priest who incenses the altar.

\rubric Towards the end of the psalm \textit{Quam dilecta} the Bishop imposes
incense into the thurible presented to him by the Incensing Priest, blessing
the incense in the usual manner. As soon as the chanters have repeated the
antiphon \textit{Erexit Jacob} the Incensing Priest hands the thurible to the
Bishop. The Bishop intones the responsory \textit{Dirigatur} (this word only)
and the chanters continue it to the end.

In the meantime the Bishop incesnes the altar in teh manner described above,
going around the altar only \textit{once} by the epistle side and returning by
the gospel side.

\rubric Having arrived at the middle in front the Bishop gives the thurible to
the Incensing Priest, who continues the incensation of the altar as before. At
the end of the responsory the Bishop's miter is removed. \textit{Orémus;
Flectámus génua; Leváte.} The Bishop recites the prayer \textit{Adsit, Dómine.}

\rubric The Bishop intones the antiphon \textit{Mane surgens Jacob} (these
three words only) which the chanters continue and to which the add the psalm
\textit{Bonum est.} The \textit{Gloria Patri} is not added and the antiphon is
repeated. The Bishop resumes his miter after the intonation and anoints the
altar a second time with the \textit{Oleum Catechumenorum} in the same manner
as described above, reciting the following formula from Chart 4.

\begin{quote}
    Sancti\cross ficétur et conse\cross crétur lapis iste. In nómine Pa\cross
    tris, et Fí\cross lii, et Spíritus \cross\ sancti: in honórem Dei, et
    gloriós\ae\ Vírginis Marí\ae, atque ómnium Sanctórum: ad nomen, et memóriam
    Sancti N. (\textit{Sanctórum N.N.}). Pax tibi.
\end{quote}

During this ceremony the Deacon and Subdeacon will hold the borders of the
Bishop's cope. After the last unction the Bishop wipes his thumb in cotton, and
the Deacon and Subdeacon give the \textit{Oleum Catechumenorum} and Chart 4 to
the servers.

\rubric Towards the end of the psalm \textit{Bonum est} the Bishop imposes
incense in the thurible presented to him by the Incensing Priest, and blesses
the incense in the usual manner. As soon as the chanters have repeated the
antiphon \textit{Mane surgens Jacob} the Incensing Priest hands the thurible to

Flectámus génua; Leváte.} The Bishop recites the prayers \textit{Adésto Dómine}
and \textit{Omnípotens\dots altáre hoc.}

\rubric After these prayers the server hadns the vessel containing the Chrism
to the Deacon and the Bishop intones the antiphon \textit{Unxit te Deus} (these
three words only), which the chanters continue and to which they add the psalm
\textit{Eructávit cor meum.}\footcite[The antiphon \textit{Unxit te Deus} may
be repested after each verse of this psalm.][footnote 1, p. 104.]{consecranda}
The \textit{Gloria Patri} is not said and the antiphon is repeated.

After intoning the antiphon the Bishop resumes him miter and then anoints the

\textit{Oleum Catechumenorum} and the \textit{Sanctum Chrisma,} and a large
quantity of cotton and a rought towel.

\rubric At the end of the responsory the Bishop's miter is removed.
\textit{Orémus; Flectámus génua; Leváte.} The Bishop says the prayer
\textit{Descéndat, qu\'\ae sumus.}

\rubric The Bishop intones the antiphon \textit{Sanctificávit} (this word
only), which the chanters contineu and to which they add the psalm \textit{Deus
noster refúgium.}\footcite[The antiphon \textit{Sanctificávit Dóminus} may be
repeated after each verse of this psalm.][footnote 1, p. 108.]{consecranda} The
\textit{Glória Patri} is not said and the antiphon is repeated.

\rubric Having intoned the antiphon \textit{Sanctificávit,} the Bishop resumes
the miter. The Deacon receives from the cleric the cruets containing the Chrism
and the Oil of the Catechumens which he hands to the Bishop. The latter takes
the cruets in his right hand (or one cruet in each hand) and pours the holy
oils conjointly on the middle of the altar in a straight line from the epistle
side to the gospel side. The Bishop gives the cruets to the Deacon, who hands
them to the server to return them to the credence. The Bishop draws back the
right sleeve of his cassock and alb\footnote{An elastic or rubber band may be
used to keep the bishop's sleeve back. The deacon, subdeacon and masters of
ceremonies must take great care to prevent the bishop's sleeves touching the
altar.} and with the palm of his right hand rubs spreads the holy oils over the
entire surface of the altar, first towards the back of the altar and then
towards the front of it. The Deacon and Subdeacon hold the borders of the
Bishop's cope.

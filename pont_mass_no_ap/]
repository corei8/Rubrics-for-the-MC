\section{Confession, Introit, Gloria}

place of AP.}, MC2 to the right of SD.

\rubric All bow to the choir, D removes miter, SD hands book of Gospels to MC2,
and Mass begins.

\rubric SD imposes maniple at \textit{Indulgéntiam}.

\rubric After kissing the altar, B turns to his left and kisses the book of
Gospels, held by SD, the text pointed out by MC1. MC2 takes the book from SD
and goes to the Epistle side to prepare book- and candle-bearers.

\rubric B incenses the altar assisted by D and SD. SD\footnote{S.R.C. n. 2138}
imposes miter and D incenses B with three swings.

\rubric B receives crozier, turns to bow to the cross, and then goes
\textit{per breviorum} to the faldstool, flanked by D and SD.

\rubric B sits for a few moments, then crozier away, D removes miter, B turns
to the left to face the altar and reads the introit. Candle-bearer stands to
the right of the book bearer. D stands to the right of B, SD to his
left\footcite[See note 5, p. 241,][]{stehle}.

\rubric B recites \textit{Kyrie} with the ministers, turns to the right to face
the people, sits and receives miter and gremiale from D. D and SD bow to B and
sit.

\rubric Minsters rise after the last \textit{Kyrie}\footcite[][227, p.
241]{stehle}, gremiale and miter removed by D; D and SD stand \textit{unum post
alium}. B intones the \textit{Gloria}; D and SD flank B for the recitation. B
and ministers sit for the remainder of the sung \textit{Glória}.

\rubric At the end of the \textit{Glória} B and ministers rise, D and SD stand
\textit{unum post alium} and B sings \textit{Dóminum vobíscum.} B sings the
orations. SD receives the Book of Epistles from MC2 after the last \textit{Per
Dóminum}, and stands with MC2 some distance from B.


\section{Epistle and Gospel}

\rubric B and D sit. SD bows to B and sings the Epistle; afterwards he repeats
the reverence, goes the middle and genuflects, and kneels to receive the
bishop's blessing.
